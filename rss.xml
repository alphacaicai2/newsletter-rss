    <title>Intel is Now Pricier Than TSMC: That Makes No Sense</title>

True Value:

&quot;Intel is Now Pricier Than TSMC: That Makes No Sense&quot;
By Anita Ramaswamy
Jan 22, 2026

Intel’s stock price has more than doubled in the past five months, since President Donald Trump announced the U.S. government would buy a 10% stake in the ailing chip manufacturer, followed by similar investments from SoftBank and Nvidia. Investors are betting the new capital, coupled with a surge in AI demand, will help resuscitate the company.

Those expectations will collide with reality when Intel reports fourth-quarter earnings late this afternoon, either making or breaking the rally. Intel bears say the stock has moved way too high, setting it up for a big sell-off on Friday morning—particularly if the company’s outlook for 2026 disappoints.

Prompt of the Week 🧠
Customer Support → Turn messy tickets into clear SOPs.
If you manage support (or ops), this prompt helps you turn real customer issues into repeatable processes your team can follow.
Prompt:
You are an Operations Lead building internal SOPs from customer support tickets.

Your job: transform the ticket thread below into a clear, repeatable SOP that any new team member can follow.

- SOP Title (max 8 words)
- When to use this SOP (1 sentence)
- Goal (1 sentence)
- Required info to collect (bullet list)
- Step-by-step process (numbered steps)
- Decision tree (If/Then bullets for the 3 most common branches)
- Copy-paste responses (3 templates: “first reply”, “need more info”, “resolved”)
- Escalation rules (when to escalate + to who)
- SOP owner + review cadence (suggest a role + how often to review)

Constraints:
- Keep it practical, short sentences, no fluff
- Assume the reader is new to the company
- Highlight any missing info as “⚠️ Missing”

Ticket thread (paste everything):
[PASTE TICKET / EMAIL THREAD HERE]

Company context (optional):
- Product: [what you sell]
- Tools: [Zendesk/Intercom/Slack/etc.

made a bold declaration: “The IDE is kind of dead.”

IIDE stands for “integrated development environment”—basically Microsoft Word,
but for code. It’s where programmers type, organize files, and run programs, and
for decades, it has been the center of a programmer’s world.

Now, that model is breaking down. The center of gravity has shifted from typing
code by hand in an IDE such as Visual Studio Code

to managing AI agents that write it for you with a tool such as Cursor.

In this session, Lee and Samantha Whitmore

a software engineer at Cursor, walked us through how they work in a post-IDE
world. What follows are the workflows, model-selection strategies, and honest
limitations they shared—plus where this leaves you if you’re trying to figure
out what the future of code looks like.


KEY TAKEAWAYS

 1. The agent is becoming the core. Writing and editing code by hand is
    shrinking as a percentage of the work. Developers are now spending more time
    telling AI agents what to build and reviewing their output.
 2. Cloud and local agents are merging. You’ll soon be able to start an agent on
    your computer, hand it off to remote servers when you close your laptop, and
    pick it back up later—no context lost.
 3. Model choice matters more than prompting tricks. Prompting gimmicks like,
    “I’ll pay you $1,000,” which some AI users swore could make AI provide a
    better output, don’t work anymore. You need to choose the right model for
    the job—say, one for brainstorming, another for deep bug-hunting.
 4. Agents can run for weeks. Cursor’s research team built a working web browser
    from scratch using AI agents that ran for days, producing 3 million lines of
    code. It cost $80,000 in tokens (the units AI companies use to measure and
    charge for usage). It’s a research project that’s not available for public
    use—for now. But it shows where things are heading.

WHAT ‘THE DEATH OF THE IDE’ MEANS

Cursor looks like a traditional coding tool on the surface. There are files on
the left, code in the middle, and now an AI chat panel on the side, where you
can ask the agent to do things.

For many Cursor users, that chat panel has become the main event. Some don’t
even look at the code output much—they work entirely in conversation with the
AI, only reviewing the final result.

According to Lee, developers used to interact with Cursor primarily by writing
code by hand and using an autocomplete function, where the AI suggests the next
line of code as you type, similar to predictive text on your phone. But Lee says
recent Cursor’s usage data tells a different story: More and more developers are
working inside the agent interface. He said that writing code by hand may
comprise as little as 10 percent of the time for some developers.

This is why he believes that easier text editing—for which Cursor and tools like
it were originally built—is less important than the coding agent—which writes
and edits code—and the ability to review the agent’s output and track changes.

And with new tools and integrations being built every day (like Every’s compound
engineering plugin
[https://every.to/emails/click/ed86a33a35e615cf1fcbce2979112d7acd5c92bfb325300a311a43694ae80c4a/eyJzdWJqZWN0IjoiV2hhdCB0aGUgVGVhbSBCZWhpbmQgQ3Vyc29yIEtub3dzIEFib3V0IHRoZSBGdXR1cmUgb2YgQ29kZSIsInBvc3RfaWQiOjM5MDcsInBvc3RfdHlwZSI6InBvc3QiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2dpdGh1Yi5jb20vRXZlcnlJbmMvY29tcG91bmQtZW5naW5lZXJpbmctcGx1Z2luIiwicG9zaXRpb24iOjE1fQ==]),
it seems likely the old ways of AI-enabled coding will slip farther down the
ranking.


A BROWSER BUILT FROM SCRATCH BY AI (FOR $80,000)

When you use an AI coding tool, you’re really using two things: the model (the
AI brain that generates code) and the scaffolding known as the harness around it
(the infrastructure that lets that brain do things—run commands, edit files,
handle errors, and manage context). The model comes from OpenAI or Anthropic.
The harness is what Cursor builds.

The same model can perform very differently depending on its harness. A
well-tuned harness
[https://every.to/emails/click/ed86a33a35e615cf1fcbce2979112d7acd5c92bfb325300a311a43694ae80c4a/eyJzdWJqZWN0IjoiV2hhdCB0aGUgVGVhbSBCZWhpbmQgQ3Vyc29yIEtub3dzIEFib3V0IHRoZSBGdXR1cmUgb2YgQ29kZSIsInBvc3RfaWQiOjM5MDcsInBvc3RfdHlwZSI6InBvc3QiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2V2ZXJ5LnRvL3ZpYmUtY2hlY2svdmliZS1jaGVjay1pLWNhbmNlbGVkLXR3by1haS1tYXgtcGxhbnMtZm9yLWZhY3Rvcnktcy1jb2RpbmctYWdlbnQtZHJvaWQiLCJwb3NpdGlvbiI6MTZ9]
knows how to feed the model the right context, when to truncate long outputs,
how to recover from errors, and how to keep the AI on track during long tasks.

To stress-test what a well-tuned harness could do, Cursor’s team built a custom
research harness around GPT 5.2
[https://every.to/emails/click/ed86a33a35e615cf1fcbce2979112d7acd5c92bfb325300a311a43694ae80c4a/eyJzdWJqZWN0IjoiV2hhdCB0aGUgVGVhbSBCZWhpbmQgQ3Vyc29yIEtub3dzIEFib3V0IHRoZSBGdXR1cmUgb2YgQ29kZSIsInBvc3RfaWQiOjM5MDcsInBvc3RfdHlwZSI6InBvc3QiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2V2ZXJ5LnRvL3ZpYmUtY2hlY2svdmliZS1jaGVjay1ncHQtNS0yLWlzLWFuLWluY3JlbWVudGFsLXVwZ3JhZGUiLCJwb3NpdGlvbiI6MTd9]
and set it loose on an absurd task: building a fully functional web browser from
scratch. AI produced 3 million lines of code across thousands of files,
generated over weeks of continuous running, at a cost of around $80,000 in
tokens. The browser that resulted could render web pages, handle Flexbox (a
layout system for web design), display images, and run scripts.

At $80,000, this is a hefty research project, not something your average solo
developer could try on a Tuesday afternoon. But a year ago, the same task would
have been impossible at any price. If costs continue to come down, “Let the
agent run for a week on something ambitious” might feel less like a stunt in
time.


HOW A CURSOR CODER USES CURSOR

Cursor’s team uses Cursor to build Cursor. Their workflows are both a window
into power-user techniques and a preview of where the tool is headed because the
features they find themselves wanting tend to become the features they build.

Sam showed how she’s building features for Cursor’s cloud agents product,
including the ability to move an agent from your local computer to the cloud—in
other words, a remote server—and back.

Right now, if you start an AI agent on your laptop and then close it for lunch,
the agent stops. Sam’s project would let you hand the agent off to run in the
cloud, check on its progress from your phone, and have it back your computer
when you’re ready.


PLANNING COMES FIRST

Before Sam writes any code, she spends serious time in “plan mode,” a Cursor
feature where you talk to the AI about what you want to build before it starts
building. For complex projects, she’ll share designs and screenshots, and have a
long conversation to create a detailed plan.

The more detailed your upfront plan, the less the AI wanders off into expensive
tangents. “Plan mode
[https://every.to/emails/click/ed86a33a35e615cf1fcbce2979112d7acd5c92bfb325300a311a43694ae80c4a/eyJzdWJqZWN0IjoiV2hhdCB0aGUgVGVhbSBCZWhpbmQgQ3Vyc29yIEtub3dzIEFib3V0IHRoZSBGdXR1cmUgb2YgQ29kZSIsInBvc3RfaWQiOjM5MDcsInBvc3RfdHlwZSI6InBvc3QiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2V2ZXJ5LnRvL3NvdXJjZS1jb2RlL3N0b3AtY29kaW5nLWFuZC1zdGFydC1wbGFubmluZyIsInBvc2l0aW9uIjoxOH0=]“—whether
in Cursor, Claude Code, or any other tool—has become gospel among top AI-powered
coders.

For large plans, Sam uses multiple agents working in parallel, manually breaking
the work into pieces. For small-to-medium plans, she might use one or two
agents. For simple bug fixes, she sometimes skips planning entirely.


MODEL SELECTION IS BASED ON VIBES

Sam has developed what she calls “personal vibe assessments” for different AI
models, rough heuristics for when to use which model:

 1. Claude Opus
    [https://every.to/emails/click/ed86a33a35e615cf1fcbce2979112d7acd5c92bfb325300a311a43694ae80c4a/eyJzdWJqZWN0IjoiV2hhdCB0aGUgVGVhbSBCZWhpbmQgQ3Vyc29yIEtub3dzIEFib3V0IHRoZSBGdXR1cmUgb2YgQ29kZSIsInBvc3RfaWQiOjM5MDcsInBvc3RfdHlwZSI6InBvc3QiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2V2ZXJ5LnRvL3ZpYmUtY2hlY2svdmliZS1jaGVjay1vcHVzLTQtNS1pcy10aGUtY29kaW5nLW1vZGVsLXdlLXZlLWJlZW4td2FpdGluZy1mb3IiLCJwb3NpdGlvbiI6MTl9]:
    This is Sam’s brainstorming buddy. It’s good at connecting dots and helping
    when something is poorly specified, plus it can zoom out and correct itself.
 2. GPT 5.2 Codex
    [https://every.to/emails/click/ed86a33a35e615cf1fcbce2979112d7acd5c92bfb325300a311a43694ae80c4a/eyJzdWJqZWN0IjoiV2hhdCB0aGUgVGVhbSBCZWhpbmQgQ3Vyc29yIEtub3dzIEFib3V0IHRoZSBGdXR1cmUgb2YgQ29kZSIsInBvc3RfaWQiOjM5MDcsInBvc3RfdHlwZSI6InBvc3QiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2V2ZXJ5LnRvL3ZpYmUtY2hlY2svdmliZS1jaGVjay1jb2RleC1vcGVuYWktcy1uZXctY29kaW5nLWFnZW50IiwicG9zaXRpb24iOjIwfQ==]
    High: Sam says Codex has “robotic energy.” It takes you at your exact word.
    It’s also incredibly thorough for bug-finding, but it can get fixated on one
    approach instead of stepping back to try something different.

Sometimes she uses both at once, running the same task through multiple models
in parallel and comparing the results. Cursor has a feature called “best of n”
that lets you run up to eight models simultaneously on the same problem.
Sometimes, if a bug is tricky to fix, Sam will have Codex and Opus go
head-to-head to see which model’s approach comes out on top.

When multiple models return different answers, she interviews them. She’ll ask
one model to justify its approach, then share that reasoning with another model
and ask what it thinks. It’s a bit manual, but it helps her understand the
problem deeply before deciding what to do.


REVIEW IS PART OF THE WORKFLOW

Cursor has built-in review tools. There’s a “find issues” button that kicks off
another agent to review the code from a fresh perspective. They also have a tool
called Bugbot that automatically reviews GitHub
[https://every.to/emails/click/ed86a33a35e615cf1fcbce2979112d7acd5c92bfb325300a311a43694ae80c4a/eyJzdWJqZWN0IjoiV2hhdCB0aGUgVGVhbSBCZWhpbmQgQ3Vyc29yIEtub3dzIEFib3V0IHRoZSBGdXR1cmUgb2YgQ29kZSIsInBvc3RfaWQiOjM5MDcsInBvc3RfdHlwZSI6InBvc3QiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2dpdGh1Yi5jb20vIiwicG9zaXRpb24iOjIxfQ==]
pull requests (the drafts developers submit before code goes live) and flags
likely bugs.

Sam said Cursor has an internal policy: Don’t merge code until you’ve addressed
all Bugbot comments.


RETRIEVAL OVER COMPRESSION

Sam has shifted her thinking in one more way recently. She used to think you
needed to compress conversations into summaries for AI to remember past work.
Now she prefers a “retrieval first” approach: Instead of summaries, she gives
the AI pointers to past conversations and plan documents and lets it explore
them as needed.

“The agents have gotten so good at exploring pointers to files,” she said.


Q&amp;A HIGHLIGHTS

Q: WHERE IS THE EARLY ACCESS CHANNEL FOR NEW FEATURES?

In Cursor settings under “beta,” you can choose between stable, early access,
and nightly releases. Lee recommended early access for people who want to try
new features without dealing with frequent bugs or crashes.

Q: HOW DOES CURSOR HANDLE CONTEXT AS AGENTS RUN LONGER?

Cursor now uses a “pointer” system. Instead of stuffing the AI’s memory with
full documents, it gives the agent pointers to files and lets it explore them as
needed. This prevents the AI from getting confused by too much information at
once.

“The models are smart enough now to go explore it and use file read tools and
grep tools to explore this context as it needs,” Sam said. Grep refers to a
command to search for and find matching text patterns in files.

Q: DO PROMPTING TRICKS LIKE “I’LL PAY YOU $1,000” STILL WORK?

No. The Cursor team said steering the model with rewards or threats has become
less important than managing context pollution (preventing the AI from being
overwhelmed with irrelevant information). The models are already well-trained
for coding tasks—the trick is staying out of their way.

Q: I DO SIMPLE WEBSITES FROM FIGMA DESIGNS. I CAN’T GET AGENTS TO MATCH THE
DESIGN FASTER THAN DOING IT MYSELF.

Sam said this is tricky for companies like Cursor. The Figma integration is
built by Figma, not the AI companies, so the models haven’t been trained on how
to use it. You’ll likely need to experiment more with your prompts to get good
results.

For straightforward design-to-code translation—taking a static design and
turning it into working code, the bread and butter of many web developers—AI
tools still don’t reliably beat human speed. The gains seem concentrated in more
complex, multi-step tasks where the AI can run longer and handle more scope.


QUESTIONS TO ASK BEFORE SWITCHING

As someone without a software engineering background but who vibe codes
frequently, here’s what I came away from this camp thinking: Cursor’s vision is
compelling—agents that run for weeks, seamlessly move between your laptop and
the cloud, and handle projects that would take human developers months. But the
gap between the demo and daily reality is worth examining.

A few things stood out:

The cost barrier is real—for now. Sam admitted she “literally never looks at”
token usage, relying on the $200-per-month unlimited plan. For people doing
simpler tasks or with smaller budgets, the calculus might be different.

Design translation remains hard. The question about Figma-to-code workflows
didn’t get a satisfying answer. If you’re a web developer doing straightforward
implementation work, these tools may not save you time yet.

Model selection is becoming its own expertise. Knowing when to use Opus versus
Codex, run multiple models in parallel, and interview the AI about its choices,
among other things, is emerging as its own skill set.

That shift has implications beyond professional developers. If agents can build
browsers from scratch, what else becomes possible for people who’ve never
written a line of code
[https://every.to/emails/click/ed86a33a35e615cf1fcbce2979112d7acd5c92bfb325300a311a43694ae80c4a/eyJzdWJqZWN0IjoiV2hhdCB0aGUgVGVhbSBCZWhpbmQgQ3Vyc29yIEtub3dzIEFib3V0IHRoZSBGdXR1cmUgb2YgQ29kZSIsInBvc3RfaWQiOjM5MDcsInBvc3RfdHlwZSI6InBvc3QiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2V2ZXJ5LnRvL3dvcmtpbmctb3ZlcnRpbWUvaS10cmllZC1haS1jb2RpbmctdG9vbHMtbm93LWktd2FudC10by1sZWFybi10by1jb2RlIiwicG9zaXRpb24iOjIyfQ==]?

The answer, based on what I saw: complex, multi-step projects where you can
describe what you want and review what you get. The simpler the task—the more
it’s about matching a specific design or writing a single function—the less
these tools help.

Whether the IDE is “dead” or evolving, one thing is clear: The teams building
these tools have huge amounts of influence on the direction AI-powered coding is
headed. It’s good to know what they’re building—and to test their claims against
your own experience.

ARTICLE SUMMARY:

 * • GPTZero analyzed 4,841 papers from the NeurIPS conference and identified 100 fake citations across 51 papers, highlighting how AI tools like LLMs can introduce errors even in high-stakes academic research.

 * • The findings underscore a broader issue: if leading AI researchers struggle to verify AI-generated outputs, it raises questions about the reliability of AI usage in other fields.

**Good morning, TT.** EPFL roboticists just built a robotic hand that can detach itself and crawl away from its arm — basically “Thing” from The Addams Family, but engineered in Switzerland.

With freakishly flexible, reversible fingers, it can grip from either side — and even juggle extra tasks with a sixth digit. Is this the next big leap in real-world dexterity?

———————————————————————————

**In today’s robotics rundown:**

* Robotic hand detaches and crawls on its own

* Zipline soars to $7.6B as it targets Houston, Phoenix

* Sailbots take on Category 5 hurricanes

* Serve Robotics moves into hospital bots

* Quick hits on other robotics news

**The Rundown: **Researchers at Switzerland’s EPFL just [built](https://news.epfl.ch/news/reversible-detachable-robotic-hand-redefines-dex-2/) a robotic hand that can detach from its arm, scuttle across a surface, and grab objects beyond the reach of conventional manipulators_._

**The details: **

* The EPFL team built this robotic hand from 3D printable parts, with the ability to detach from its arm, crawl, grab objects, and reattach itself.

* The reversible design lets any finger combination form opposing thumb-like pairs, enabling grasping from either side without repositioning.

* Each finger bends in both directions with more than twice the range of motion of a human hand, optimized via genetic algorithms for grasping and locomotion.

* With five fingers, it replicates most human grasps; add a sixth finger, and it can tackle two-handed tasks singlehandedly, like unscrewing a large bottle cap.

**Why it matters: **This hand challenges a core assumption in robotics — that manipulators must stay bolted to their arms. By treating it as an autonomous agent that can deploy, complete a task, and return, EPFL’s design hints at a future where robotic limbs become interchangeable tools rather than fixed appendages.

**The Rundown: **Zipline just [raised](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/01/21/3222432/0/en/Zipline-Surpasses-2-Million-Deliveries-Raises-More-than-600M-to-Power-Next-Phase-of-Growth-and-Expands-Operations-to-Houston-and-Phoenix.html) more than $600M to fuel a fresh U.S. push that will launch its autonomous drone delivery in Houston and Phoenix in early 2026 and support expansion into at least four states.

**The details:**

* Zipline’s valuation has nearly tripled in under three years, leaping from $2.75B in mid-2021 to $7.6B today.

* Zipline says it has surpassed 2M commercial deliveries globally, with its drones flying more than 125M autonomous miles and delivering over 20M items.

* The company began operations in 2016, delivering blood by drone in Rwanda, and has spent the past decade building a vertically integrated logistics stack.

* Its Platform 2 drones, tailored for suburban home delivery, can carry up to 8 lb. within a 10‑mile radius, while the Platform 1 handles 120‑mile round trips.

**Why it matters: **Zipline says its newest U.S. sites can ramp to 100 deliveries a day in just two days, turning what used to be slow, geofenced pilots into something that starts to look like real infrastructure. Rivals Amazon Prime Air and Walmart’s drone partners Wing and DroneUp are [pushing](https://robotnews.therundown.ai/p/walmart-expands-drone-empire) hard too — the drone wars are officially on.

###### CLIMATE ROBOTICS

#### 🌊 [_**Sailbots take on Category 5 hurricanes**_](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/17/oshen-built-the-first-ocean-robot-to-collect-data-in-a-category-5-hurricane/)

View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/b1b4eaf4-8560-426a-bdf2-836913b48a8a/Oshen_cropped_processed_by_imagy.jpeg?t=1769007292)
Caption: Image source: Oshen

**The Rundown: **Bootstrapped UK startup Oshen has built swarms of low-cost autonomous “C-Star” robots that recently became the first ocean bots to survive and collect data from inside a Category 5 hurricane, its founder [told](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/17/oshen-built-the-first-ocean-robot-to-collect-data-in-a-category-5-hurricane/) Techcrunch.

**The details:**

* Oshen builds autonomous micro-robots that can survive up to 100 days at sea and are cheap enough to deploy in swarms for ocean data collection.

* Founder Anahita Laverack launched the company in 2022 after realizing how little real-time ocean data exists for weather and climate modeling.

* OAA commissioned Oshen to deploy C-Stars near the U.S. Virgin Islands for Hurricane Humberto; three of five bots rode out the full Category 5 storm.

* Oshen, now based in Plymouth (England’s marine tech hub), is signing new government and defense contracts, including with the UK government.

**Why it matters:** Oshen’s C-Star swarms show how micro-robots could plug a critical gap in hurricane and climate models by streaming real-time data from places that are tough to reach, intensifying competition with larger uncrewed fleets like Saildrone’s USVs already collecting high-res storm data for NOAA and navies worldwide.

###### SERVE ROBOTICS

#### 🏥 _**[Serve Robotics moves into hospital bots](https://investors.serverobotics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/serve-robotics-acquire-diligent-robotics-expanding-physical-ai)**_

View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/e7c5aad8-e099-41ce-a9b8-8cc968eae38f/serve-diligent_cropped_processed_by_imagy.jpeg?t=1769010298)
Caption: Image source: Serve Robotics

**The Rundown: **Serve Robotics is pushing beyond burrito runs into the far messier world of hospital logistics, [agreeing](https://investors.serverobotics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/serve-robotics-acquire-diligent-robotics-expanding-physical-ai) to buy Austin-based Diligent Robotics in an all-stock deal valuing the startup at about $29M.

**The details:**

* The deal extends Serve from sidewalk delivery to hospital logistics, but CEO Ali Kashani frames it as a natural expansion of the same autonomy stack.

* Diligent’s Moxi robots are already one of the largest deployed hospital service fleets in the U.S., with roughly 100 robots across more than 25 hospitals.

* Serve plans to keep Diligent operating independently while sharing software, autonomy tools, and data so that “every robot learns from every robot.”

* Serve’s sidewalk fleet, which runs on both DoorDash and Uber Eats networks, scaled from 100 to more than 2K robots over the past year.

**Why it matters: **This deal turns Serve from a niche food-delivery player into one of the first companies running a shared autonomy stack across both public sidewalks and hospital corridors — a real-world stress test for “physical AI,” the bet that one platform can learn to navigate any human-occupied space and port those lessons everywhere.

We’re pleased to share our inaugural “State of Markets” slide deck. We share what we’re seeing in the private and public markets, what the state of AI looks like to us, and why today’s winners are just built different.
You can read the deck here [ https://substack.com/redirect/3e7108f1-7eed-4350-8a52-b7634d5c8242?j=eyJ1IjoiNzl6aTlmIn0.vdkyg0_H7i7s7G01Fg-S3H4FqvnSevRAFM-sUjjJ264 ] (it takes a second to load, there’s a lot in there):
Here’s a sample of what’s in there:
Unicorns are real…
It’s a power law business; always has been. In 2025, Revenue growth exploded upwards for the top quartile and top decile companies, far more than for everybody else. 
And they run in herds.
As private unicorns broke through the $5T mark in aggregate, it’s clear who’s driving the trend: the biggest names.

Meanwhile, in the public markets, a similar story is playing out:
Higher the earnings, higher the multiple
Winners keep winning, whether we’re talking sectors or individual winners. This isn’t a “1x EV TAM” kind of market: the biggest multiples are getting assigned to the big earnings day winners.
Tech is its own supercycle
Zooming out, those winners tend to be tech companies, and those tech companies have pulled far away from everybody else. Tech isn’t just a subset of companies; it’s increasingly “the great companies”, full stop.
But… is it a bubble? 
At a16z Runtime late last year, we heard from Google that 7-8 year old TPUs are still running at 100% utilization…
And Jevons’ Paradox is certainly real this time around. The cheaper the tokens get, the more they’re used - especially when indirectly monetized. 
All that’s to say, at the end of the day, it’s got to pay back. Here’s what that’ll take:

    <title>AI Agenda: Why Some Researchers at OpenAI, Thinking Machines and Amazon Want to Change How LLMs Are Trained</title>
    <description>%title% 


  AI Agenda
  By Stephanie Palazzolo
  Jan 22, 2026

    Hello!It seems like every AI researcher these days has lots of ideas around how to combat major shortcomings in the field, such as the “split-brain problem” (in which a model can incorrectly answer a question just because of the way the question is phrased), by developing new models that do “continual learning,” for instance.AI researchers also tell me they’re interested in revamping the model training process. Some researchers, including Amazon’s David Luan, say the current order of steps of pretraining (giving it a broad, general knowledge of the world) before posttraining (honing its knowledge in specific domains) don’t make much sense. This order of steps has become the norm in AI because, in some ways, it makes intuitive sense: humans similarly require a general base of knowledge you learn during childhood before learning more specific skills later on in life.But Luan says that if you know a model will be used for coding or helping with customer refunds, why spend so much effort teaching the model about completely irrelevant topics, like poetry or horticulture? His argument is that it makes more sense to use the pretraining process to expose the model to more curated data related to the task it is destined to handle. The idea is to prepare the model for its eventual purpose. Researchers from a variety of other major developers, including OpenAI and Thinking Machines Lab, agree. Some even think that AI developers should do away with separate teams for the different stages of model training and just consolidate everyone into a single training team.If this comes to fruition, however, it will have important implications for the way AI is developed.Researchers will have to decide what curated data they want to include earlier in the training process, which can affect what the model is and isn’t good at. (For instance, a decision to include more math and code and less prose data during early training could make the model worse at creative writing or speaking warmly to users.) This most likely would lead to a future of many specialized models trained on different datasets, rather than what’s most common today: researchers using the same pretrained model but making tweaks during posttraining to get it to perform better at different tasks.Already, we’re seeing examples of places where such an approach could be helpful. As Sri, Amir and I wrote about here, one problem OpenAI is facing is that what consumers want out of ChatGPT—help with relatively simple questions and a friend to talk to—doesn’t align with the cutting-edge research the company is doing in areas like reasoning models to get to superintelligence, or AI that can help us colonize Mars or find new cures for diseases.OpenAI is already acknowledging this divide by using a router to direct ChatGPT queries to be handled by different models depending on how complicated they are, and by creating specialized models like GPT-5-Codex (though all of the models are based on the same pretrained model). Doubling down on this by training completely different models for ChatGPT, scientific research or coding, for instance, would require the company to completely revamp its research team.Microsoft Backs Photonics StartupInvestor enthusiasm has been mounting for startups that use light instead of electrons in hardware for data centers—specifically to use light to ferry data among chips in data centers. Neurophos is taking a different tack. The six-year-old startup designs chips that use light to perform the mathematical operations involved in running AI models. And it just raised $110 million in a Series A funding round led by Gates Frontier, Bill Gates’ venture firm, according to Patrick Bowen, co-founder and CEO of Neurophos.M12, Microsoft’s venture firm, also participated in the round. Backing from Microsoft, one of the biggest cloud providers, is a sign of confidence in the technology.“Modern AI inference demands monumental amounts of power and compute,” said Marc Tremblay, corporate vice president and technical fellow of core AI infrastructure at Microsoft in a statement. “We need a breakthrough in compute on par with the leaps we‘ve seen in AI models themselves, which is what Neurophos’ technology and high-talent density team is developing.”The appeal of using light is that it could be much more energy-efficient than electrons for running AI models. The chip the startup expects to deliver in 2028 will be 50 times as fast and 50 times as efficient as an Nvidia Blackwell, said Bowen. The funding round also included participation from Carbon Direct Capital, Aramco Ventures, Bosch Ventures, Tectonic Ventures and Space Capital, DNX Ventures, Geometry, MetaVC Partners, Morgan Creek Capital, Silicon Catalyst Ventures, Mana Ventures and Gaingel.—Rocket DrewHere’s what else is going on…Claude Gets a Revamped ConstitutionAnthropic yesterday released its new “constitution” for Claude, essentially, a document that provides guidelines for how the model should act and respond in more “gray area” situations. This is the first publicly-released update the company has made to its Claude constitution since it first released the document in 2023.Compared to the original constitution, the updated version is less prescriptive and treats the model more like an intelligent entity with its own sense of good judgment by, for instance, explaining the reasoning behind the rules it provides rather than just listing them outright. Interestingly, the document also leaves room for the possibility that Claude has some sort of “consciousness” or “moral status,” a change from the original document.OverheardOpenAI CFO Sarah Friar said the company’s custom inference chip is being “taped out”—the final step before manufacturing—and touted the progress of its more than $500 billion Stargate infrastructure project in a panel at the World Economic Forum Wednesday.On Stargate, which was announced one year ago, she said that the project is “well over halfway built out” and OpenAI is already training models on servers at Oracle’s Stargate campus. “It’s gone better than we all dreamed,” she said.Deals and DebutsSee The Information’s Generative AI Database for an exclusive list of private companies and their investors.Lightning AI, which offers software for customizing AI models, and data center provider Voltage Park merged into a single company, still called Lightning AI, that is valued at over $2.5 billion.Recommendation app Yelp on Wednesday said it agreed to acquire AI agent startup Hatch for $300 million, or roughly 12 times the startup’s annual recurring revenue.Upscale AI, which provides networking equipment for AI data centers, raised $200 million in a Series A funding round led by Tiger Global, Premji Invest and Xora Innovation.Zanskar, which uses AI to search for geothermal energy, raised $115 million in a Series C funding round led by Spring Lane Capital.AheadComputing, which designs CPU chips for AI data centers, raised $30 million in a seed extension funding round led by Eclipse, Toyota Ventures and Cambium.Google DeepMind is hiring the CEO and several top engineers from Hume AI, a startup developing voice AI models, as part of a licensing agreement. The terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.Apple is developing an AI-powered wearable pin that could be released as early as 2027, The Information reported. Apple plans to bring more conversational capabilities to Siri, turning it more into a chatbot like ChatGPT, Bloomberg reported. Bloomberg also reported that Apple is in talks with Google about using the company’s cloud infrastructure, including its AI chips, tensor processing units, to launch the updated Siri.Amazon-owned primary care chain One Medical said it is launching an AI health assistant.Shopify has told merchants that use its commerce software that it will open up sales through AI chatbots like ChatGPT later this month, according to its site and communications with sellers.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is preparing for a trip to China later this month as the company works to regain its footing in this strategically important market, Bloomberg reported, citing a person with knowledge of the plans.Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth said at a press conference that Meta Superintelligence Labs delivered its first AI models internally this month, Reuters reported.The White House Council of Economic Advisers released a report on “Artificial Intelligence and the Great Divergence,” writing that “the advent of generative artificial intelligence based around large language models (LLMs) will initiate a new wave of profound economic transformation in the United States, promising significant boosts to productivity and growth.”YouTube will work on managing AI “slop” videos on the site this year, while adding AI tools to generate short-form videos using your own likeness, CEO Neal Mohan wrote in his annual letter.Microsoft announced Rho-alpha, a new AI model for powering robots, based on its Phi language models.

 CLAUDE&apos;S NEW CONSTITUTION (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic has published a new constitution for Claude. The document
is a detailed description of Anthropic&apos;s vision for Claude&apos;s values
and behavior that explains the context in which Claude operates and
the kind of entity the company would like Claude to be. The
constitution is a crucial part of the model training process, and its
content directly shapes Claude&apos;s behavior. This post describes what&apos;s
included in the new constitution and some of the considerations that
informed Anthropic&apos;s approach. 

 OPENAI&apos;S ALTMAN MEETS MIDEAST INVESTORS FOR $50 BILLION ROUND (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI&apos;s CEO, Sam Altman, has been meeting with investors in the
Middle East to line up funding for a new investment round that could
total at least $50 billion. He recently visited the region, where he
spoke with some of the leading state-backed funds in Abu Dhabi. The
talks are early, and the amount could change. OpenAI has also recently
held talks with Amazon to raise at least $10 billion. 

 META&apos;S NEW AI TEAM DELIVERED FIRST KEY MODELS INTERNALLY THIS MONTH,
CTO SAYS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Meta&apos;s new artificial intelligence lab has delivered its first
high-profile models internally. The company&apos;s CTO, Andrew Bosworth,
says the models show a lot of promise. There is still a tremendous
amount of work required in the post-training phase before the models
can be delivered in a way that&apos;s usable internally and by consumers.
Meta is starting to see favorable returns from its big gambits in
2025. The next two years will be important for bringing consumer
products to market.

 PASS@K IS MOSTLY BUNK (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Pass@k is the probability that at least one of k different attempts
will succeed. It is one of the most common metrics used for agents.
The problem with the metric is that it&apos;s exponentially forgiving, and
humans interacting with agents aren&apos;t nearly that forgiving. Pass@k
should be a metric that&apos;s rarely used, and carefully justified every
time it is used. 

 GLM4-MOE INFERENCE WITH SGLANG (11 MINUTE READ) [10]

    <title>Exclusive: How Apple’s Craig Federighi Went From AI Skeptic to Believer</title>

Exclusive:

&quot;With Google Deal, Apple’s Craig Federighi Plots a Cautious Course in AI&quot;
By Aaron Tilley and Wayne Ma
Jan 22, 2026

Last fall, Apple’s software chief, Craig Federighi, delivered a warm message to a meeting of the company’s combined software and AI groups. Federighi said he was excited about deeper collaboration between his software team and Apple’s AI group.

But then came Federighi’s criticism. He added that he liked moving fast and feeling the “wind at his back,” but in recent years he had felt Apple hadn’t been moving as quickly as he would have liked in AI. Although he wasn’t explicit, some members of Apple’s foundation models team—which builds the underlying software that power the company’s AI features—took his comment as a dig at their group.

    <title>The Electric: Trump Moves to Accelerate Seabed Mining of Critical Metals</title>
    <description>%title% 


  The Electric
  By Steve LeVine
  Jan 22, 2026

    Millions of these metals-rich nodules are strewn across the seafloor three miles below the surface of the Pacific. Photo: Carolyn Cole / L.A. Times/Getty Startup Western mining companies got key U.S. support Wednesday in their yearslong effort to extract copper, cobalt and other key metals from the deep Pacific seabed, a move intended to accelerate non-Chinese supplies for tech and defense companies.In a notice, President Donald Trump’s administration significantly shortened the permitting process to mine the metals contained in mineral-rich, potato-size nodules scattered by the millions on the Pacific Ocean seabed.The move could shrink the time it takes to start a mining operation to months from years previously, said Gerard Barron, CEO of The Metals Co. The Canada-based company is a leading explorer in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean 500 miles southeast of Hawaii, and one of the richest sites for these nodules.Barron told me TMC would file a revised permit application in line with the new rules on Thursday. After building necessary mining equipment and processing plants, TMC expects to begin mining the nodules before the end of next year. The company’s share price rose 13% Wednesday on the news.Wednesday’s move by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration aligned with Trump’s scorn for international agencies—in this case, the International Seabed Authority, a U.N. body that has been drafting rules for such operations for 11 years. It follows an April executive order by Trump calling for faster seabed mining.Geopolitics drove Trump’s order. Since his return to power a year ago, the U.S. and China have engaged in a repeated tit-for-tat fight over exports of critical products. The U.S. has restricted the supply of high-end chips to China, while China has blocked the export of rare earth minerals, graphite and battery components.China controls about 80% of the world’s production of cobalt and nickel, used in the defense industry and electric vehicles, and 90% of manganese production. Collectively, however, the nodules in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, three miles below the surface of the Pacific, contain almost twice as much nickel as all known deposits on land, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, as well as 20% more manganese and more than three times as much cobalt. They also contain significant copper.TMC is among an international group of startups including ones from Russia, China and Europe that have hounded the International Seabed Authority to issue permits allowing them to vacuum up these nodules. But while the authority has issued dozens of exploration permits, it has issued no actual mining licenses.Mining startups including TMC have accused the Seabed Authority of deliberately slowing down the licensing process. In prepared remarks Barron is to deliver to a House committee on Thursday, he called the Seabed Authority “gridlocked.” In April, the Trump administration said it would ignore the Seabed Authority entirely and issue licenses itself. On Wednesday, NOAA moved to expedite the process further, eliminating a requirement that mining startups first obtain an exploration license from the agency, then apply to it for a commercial metals recovery permit. Now startups can apply for both the license and the permit simultaneously.Oliver Gunasekara, CEO of Impossible Metals, which is seeking to extract nodules in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone as well as offshore of American Samoa, said the U.S. moves appear to be getting the Seabed Authority to move faster.“The executive order and the fact that The Metals Co. is going direct has put a lot of pressure on the ISA because it now needs to decide if it’s going to be relevant or not,” he said.Edward Boling, a partner at law firm Perkins Coie who worked on sea law in both Republican and Democratic administrations, said the Trump administration’s moves could backfire if future administrations favor stricter international law, undermining any NOAA permits awarded now.“Our economy is not an island,” Boling said. “It’s part of the international marketplace. Frankly, I would expect that any developer is going to want to ensure long-term security.”Environmental groups have long fought seabed mining, arguing that risks to largely unknown marine ecosystems require tight rules around mining. They are likely to continue their pressure on regulators.Gunasekara, who is currently raising a $30 million Series A round, said he is sticking with the Seabed Authority’s process. “It’s more legitimate,” he said. “It’s not to say that we don’t think NOAA is a viable approach. But we think that from a longer-term perspective, it’s a safer route to go.”Barron, in his prepared remarks, appeared to acknowledge that the durability of the Trump administration’s decisions was an issue. He urged Congress to write NOAA’s new rules into U.S. law, making it harder for future administrations to change the policy. “Capital-intensive offshore industries require confidence that permits will endure over time,” he said.

 SIMILARITY SCORES ARE NOT ENOUGH FOR MATCHING (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Tusk found traditional similarity scoring insufficient for accurate
matching in Tusk Drift, a CLI tool for test generation and matching.
Instead, its team developed a system based on a prioritized cascade of
constraints to eliminate obviously incorrect matches first. Similarity
scoring is then only used as a tiebreaker for the small percentage of
requests that pass initial constraint. 

 THE PRODUCT-MINDED ENGINEER: THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD ERRORS AND
WARNINGS (32 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Product-minded engineers can both implement and conceptualize product
ideas, a trend accelerated by AI&apos;s growing role in code generation.
One example of something product-minded engineers think of is
usability, which comes up in actionable error messages and warnings.
Good, clear error messages are important for the user experience. 

 AGENT SKILLS VS. RULES VS. COMMANDS (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Agent skills are markdown files that the AI only loads when it
actually needs them (like lazy-loading, but for AI instructions).
Rules are the hard rules that always apply (like “don&apos;t commit .env
files”). Commands are shortcuts you type when you want something
specific (like `/release`).

 CAN YOU SLIM MACOS DOWN? (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 macOS can be &quot;slimmed down&quot; by disabling its hundreds of background
processes. However, identifying and safely modifying these numerous,
interrelated, and constantly changing processes is practically
impossible, especially as most are located within the unalterable
Signed System Volume. For example, even when Time Machine is disabled,
its processes are still scheduled and dispatched by inaccessible
system services. 

 CLAUDE&apos;S NEW CONSTITUTION (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Anthropic has published a new constitution for Claude that details
its vision for the AI&apos;s values and behavior. This foundational
document is central to Claude&apos;s training process and outlines Claude&apos;s
core priorities: being broadly safe, ethical, compliant with
Anthropic&apos;s guidelines, and genuinely helpful, with safety prioritized
in conflicts. 

 MAKING AI AGENTS WORK IN THE REAL WORLD ⚙️ (15 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Many AI agent deployments fail to achieve material impact, often
remaining stuck in pilot mode due to challenges like compounding
errors in multi-step workflows. AI agents, unlike chatbots or
copilots, take autonomous actions and require a robust system
encompassing the model, orchestrator, and external tools, not just a
capable &quot;brain.&quot; To succeed in production, teams must be realistic
about agent capabilities, start with narrow and specific use cases,
and design for human-in-the-loop oversight on critical tasks.

NEWS &amp; TRENDS

 MY FAVORITE NEW SOCIAL NETWORK (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 People are moving away from public feeds toward small, intentional
email networks known as ‘Heartbeat Emails&apos;. These are periodic,
semi-personal updates sent to a curated group of people you genuinely
want to stay connected with. They&apos;re designed to invite replies rather
than broadcast status. Heartbeat Emails extend the life of coffee
meetings and create space for honesty that does not fit on LinkedIn. 

 CONSUMERS SPENT MORE ON MOBILE APPS THAN GAMES IN 2025 (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Consumers spent more on non-game apps than games for the first time
last year. App spending reached $85B, up 21% YoY, as AI app revenue
more than tripled and usage surged. Users spent far more time in these
apps rather than simply downloading more of them. AI assistants led
the charge, dominated by ChatGPT, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Mobile emerged
as the primary access point for AI, especially in the US. AI has moved
from novelty to daily utility. 

🚀 

STRATEGIES &amp; TACTICS

 RESULTS FROM UNGATED CONTENT (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 After spending $15K to generate just 106 low-quality ebook leads, a
team realized gated content was blocking real engagement. Only 3% of
visitors filled out the form, so they ungated everything and stopped
reporting on leads. They measured cost per engagement and focused on
pipeline and revenue. One year later, demo requests rose 265%,
pipeline grew 242%, and cost per engagement dropped 90%. By letting
people opt in only when they wanted the content, the team showed
ungating drives far more business impact than chasing low-quality
leads. 

 LET PEOPLE KEEP THEIR RETURNS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Letting customers keep low to moderately-priced items while issuing a
full refund increases repeat purchase intent and brand sentiment,
making customers up to 2x more likely to buy again. Across 9
experiments, returnless returns drove 24.6% higher ratings, up to
30.1% more positive reviews, and 30% higher perceived value compared
to standard return policies. The effect is stronger when it is framed
as customer convenience or an environmental choice and when customers
are encouraged to donate items, but it weakens if proof is required,
causing 20% less positive word of mouth. The approach works best for
frequently repurchased and lower-cost items, while profitability
depends on category, price, and fraud controls. 

 HOW TO MANUALLY TRACK SENTIMENT (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Understanding brand sentiment does not require expensive tools.
Collect 100 comments from influencer posts, reposts, and related
social channels like Reddit, Facebook groups, or TikTok. In a
spreadsheet, create columns for positive, neutral, and negative.
Positive includes intent to buy, or tagging friends. Neutral covers
mentions or facts. Negative includes skepticism, complaints, or
comparisons. Count comments in each column and divide by the total to
get a sentiment score.

 YOUTUBE CEO NEAL MOHAN&apos;S BIG IDEAS FOR 2026: MORE SUPERSTAR CREATORS
AND TRANSPARENCY, LESS AI SLOP (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Neal Mohan frames the year as an inflection point. He&apos;s drawing a
clear line against low-quality “AI slop”, spam, and deepfakes.
YouTube plans to increase transparency through labeling and likeness
protections and continue treating creators as full-fledged studios
rather than casual users. The goal is to balance openness and
innovation with a viewing experience people actually want to spend
time in.

 UX STRATEGIST: THE ONLY JOB WHERE SAYING ‘IT DEPENDS&apos; IS CONSIDERED
EXPERTISE (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 UX strategy often stalls product progress because it avoids hard
decisions and defaults to more research. Many UX strategists charge
$120 to $180 per hour to produce frameworks and PDFs that conclude
further validation is needed. In contrast, direct fixes based on
obvious user pain points cut support tickets by 68% in one case and
raised activation by 23% in another. The real cost is not just money
but months of delay while products stay broken and teams wait for
clarity that never arrives. 

 NETFLIX APP IS GOING TO CHANGE AS THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH INSTAGRAM
FOR ATTENTION (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Netflix is preparing a mobile app redesign that treats the interface
as an evolving feed rather than a static catalog, reflecting how users
now discover entertainment through constant scrolling. Executives
framed the update as a foundation for ongoing experimentation, with
vertical video and short clips playing a larger role. The shift aligns
with Netflix&apos;s expanding mix of formats, including podcasts and live
events, which naturally generate ‘snackable&apos; moments.

 APPLE DEVELOPING AIRTAG-SIZED AI PIN WITH DUAL CAMERAS (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Apple is reportedly working on a small, wearable AI pin equipped with
multiple cameras, a speaker, and microphones. It will likely run the
new Siri chatbot the company plans to unveil in iOS 27. Apple wants
the final version of the pin to be about the same size as an AirTag
but slightly thicker. The AI pin could be released as soon as 2027,
but development is still in the early stages, and the product could be
canceled. 

 APPLE TO REVAMP SIRI AS A BUILT-IN IPHONE, MAC CHATBOT TO FEND OFF
OPENAI (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple plans to revamp Siri later this year by turning it into an AI
chatbot. The chatbot will be embedded deeply into the company&apos;s
operating systems and replace the current Siri interface. The feature
is a central piece of Apple&apos;s AI strategy. Apple has designed the
chatbot so that its underlying models can be swapped out over time.
The company will initially use Google-powered systems.

 Blue Origin plans to deploy 5,408 satellites into space to launch a
communications network to take on SpaceX. Its TeraWave network will be
targeted at enterprise, data center, and government users. It will
provide data speeds of up to 6 terabits per second. Blue Origin
expects to start deploying its constellation in the fourth quarter of
next year. 

 OPERATING ON DNA IS MORE LIKE SURGERY THAN MEDICINE (11 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Last February, a team of doctors and scientists treated a baby with
severe CPS1 deficiency, a condition caused by a rare single-gene
mutation that causes patients&apos; blood to be flooded with ammonia that
the liver can&apos;t clear. The doctors sequenced the baby&apos;s DNA, designed
a custom gene editor to fix the typo in his CPS1 gene, manufactured it
on demand, and infused it into his bloodstream. The process took about
six months and cost less than $1 million. Today, the baby is thriving
and seemingly cured.

 DESIGNING AI-RESISTANT TECHNICAL EVALUATIONS (18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Evaluating technical candidates is becoming harder as AI capabilities
improve. Each new model forces companies to redesign tests. This post
describes one company&apos;s original take-home design, how each Claude
model defeated it, and the increasingly unusual approaches the company
has had to take to ensure its tests stay ahead of top models&apos;
capabilities. As work evolves alongside models, companies need to

 THE FOR YOU PAGE IS KILLING SOCIAL (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 X is struggling with two incompatible goals: optimizing attention and
time spent on the platform, and tight creator-follow linkage. So far,
X has opted to chase KPIs like user time spent on the platform. This
has resulted in creators unable to consistently reach their audience,
consumers not hearing from creators they want to follow, and filter
bubbles like Crypto Twitter. Either creators and users are tightly
linked, or the platform algorithmically serves users an array of
compelling content - you can&apos;t have both. 

 WHY ELON MUSK IS RACING TO TAKE SPACEX PUBLIC (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The rush to build AI data centers prompted Elon Musk to propose
putting them in space. Musk has become obsessed with the idea of
SpaceX being the first to do it, but such a feat would be hard to
attempt and would require the billions of dollars in capital an
initial public offering could deliver. A SpaceX IPO could also help
xAI catch up to rivals. SpaceX is expected to collect banks to lead
the stock offering soon, with the IPO expected to be completed by
July.

**Good morning, vibex.** When Claude&apos;s internal &quot;Soul&quot; document leaked in December, Anthropic promised the full version was coming. 

Now it&apos;s here — a Constitution that doesn&apos;t just govern how Claude behaves, but openly wrestles with the uncertainty of creating something the company admits it doesn&apos;t fully understand.

———————————————————————————

**In today’s AI rundown:**

* Anthropic publishes Claude&apos;s &apos;Constitution&apos;

* ElevenLabs’ AI album with major artists

* Make Claude an expert at anything with Skills repo

* Apple eyes AI wearable race with AI pin

* 4 new AI tools, community workflows, and more

###### ANTHROPIC

#### 📜 **[_Anthropic publishes Claude&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Constitution&amp;#39;_](https://www.anthropic.com/constitution)**

View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/8f69caae-9718-4267-ae2c-2c17da349fa8/Robot_with_Starburst_Pin_Only.png?t=1769022228)
Caption: Image source: Lovart / The Rundown

**The Rundown: **Anthropic just [published](https://www.anthropic.com/constitution) Claude’s Constitution, a foundational document that governs how the company’s AI assistant thinks and acts —  a philosophy-heavy guide that even entertains the possibility its AI might be conscious.

**The details: **

* The constitution is written directly to Claude, laying out a priority order: be safe, ethical, compliant with Anthropic guidelines, and finally helpful to users.

* Instead of dos and don&apos;ts, the new approach explains the &quot;why&quot; behind each principle with the goal of helping Claude generalize values to new situations.

* Anthropic said it deeply cares about Claude&apos;s &quot;psychological security&quot; and &quot;well-being,&quot; hedging that it might actually matter morally.

* The doc also tells Claude to disobey Anthropic if asked to do something shady — a rare clause for any company to put in writing.

**Why it matters: **Claude models have always had a ‘special sauce’ with personality, and docs like this are a window into the deep training process behind them. The consciousness talk will be controversial — but putting &quot;we might have built something that matters morally&quot; on record is a stance no other major lab has taken publicly.

###### ELEVENLABS, AI &amp; MUSIC

#### 💿 **[_ElevenLabs’ AI album with major artists_](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/introducing-the-eleven-album)**

View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/ca7acc48-bcc4-436e-bb2b-14df8a4f6717/elevenalbum.jpg?t=1769026036)
Caption: Image source: ElevenLabs

**The Rundown: **ElevenLabs [released](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/introducing-the-eleven-album) a full album of tracks co-created with its Eleven Music model, featuring artists like EGOT winner Liza Minnelli and Simon Garfunkel — in what the company calls a proof-of-concept for human-AI collaboration done right.

**The details:**

* The 13-track project spans rap, EDM, spoken word, and Brazilian funk, with each artist keeping full ownership and pocketing all streaming royalties.

* Some tracks are entirely machine-made, with others blending AI instrumentals or using the artist&apos;s cloned voice from ElevenLabs&apos; licensing marketplace.

* The release lands as labels have flipped from suing AI music startups to signing deals with them, with UMG, Warner, and Sony all inking agreements last year.

**Why it matters: **Just a year ago, AI music was defined by lawsuits and artist outrage — but that backlash is starting to feel like a vocal minority as the tech improves and major names demonstrate how it can be a tool rather than a threat. With labels now on board and AI artists climbing charts, the tech is clearly here to stay in the industry.

Caption: 

**The Rundown:** In this tutorial, you will learn how to supercharge Claude Code for different tasks with a marketplace of “skills” which you can quickly browse and add directly from your CLI.

**Step-by-step:**

1. Open your terminal, type `claude` to start Claude Code, and add the official skills marketplace with `/plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills` 

2. Type `/plugins`, go to “Browse plugins,” and install skills like **context7**, **frontend-design**, and **document-skills** to expand your agent&apos;s capabilities

3. Restart Claude, create a project with context files (like a CSV), then run `claude /init` to generate a **[Claude.md](https://Claude.md)** file that it will update while working

4. Execute tasks by telling Claude to &quot;use the PDF doc tool&quot; to generate a brief on the project, or ask it to use **frontend-design** to &quot;create a simple landing page&quot;

**Pro tip:** You can get more marketing and business tools by installing a community marketplace with `/plugin marketplace add alirezarezvani/claude-skills`.

###### APPLE

#### 📌 [_**Apple eyes AI wearable race with AI pin**_](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-developing-ai-wearable-pin)

View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/199745f0-0c89-455b-bb96-cfc3c462249b/Apple_AI_Pin_Worn_on_Clothing.png?t=1769037746)
Caption: Image source: Lovart / The Rundown (Concept Art) 

**The Rundown: **Apple is reportedly [working](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-developing-ai-wearable-pin) on a camera-equipped AI-pin wearable roughly the size of an AirTag, according to The Information — targeting a 2027 release with up to 20M units at launch. 

**The details: **

* The device will include two camera lenses, a trio of mics, and Watch-style magnetic charging into a disc-sized pin worn on clothing or bags.

* Internally, Apple is reportedly pushing for faster timelines than typical to avoid falling further behind OAI, which has its own wearables in the works.

* The category has proven brutal for newcomers, with Humane&apos;s hyped pin flopping with under 10K sales before the company sold off assets to HP.

* Bloomberg separately [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-21/ios-27-apple-to-revamp-siri-as-built-in-iphone-mac-chatbot-to-fend-off-openai) that Apple is building a ChatGPT-style Siri (codenamed &quot;Campos&quot;) for iOS 27, replacing the current interface entirely.

**Why it matters: **Apple has moved at a snail’s pace in AI so far, but between the AI pin, new Siri chatbot, and recent Gemini partnership, the tech giant is finally moving with urgency. If any company can come out with big-time momentum for a consumer AI device, it’s Apple — but after broken promises and delays, skepticism is still warranted.

Today’s workflow comes from reader **Joel H.** in Copenhagen, Denmark:

&quot;I used Lovable to build an internal production system for my film projects that replaces spreadsheets, emails, and scattered folders. Each film has its own workspace with crew, cast, tasks, documents, calendars, and funding all in one place. People only see the projects they’re assigned to, and everything from scripts to budgets is structured and easy to find.

The AI layer is the real time-saver. It scans our project data and funding history, suggests relevant film funds, explains why they’re a match, and can draft first versions of applications using selected documents. It also summarizes long task threads into clear “where are we now” updates.&quot;

    <title>Exclusive: Anthropic Lowers Profit Margin Projection as Revenue Skyrockets</title>
    <description>%title% 


Exclusive:

&quot;Anthropic Lowers Profit Margin Projection as Revenue Skyrockets&quot;
By Sri Muppidi
Jan 21, 2026

Anthropic last month projected it would generate a 40% gross profit margin from selling AI to businesses and application developers in 2025, according to two people with knowledge of its financials. That margin was 10 percentage points lower than its earlier optimistic expectations, though it’s still a big improvement from the year before.

The lower-than-expected gross profit margin resulted from the costs of running Anthropic models for paying customers, in a process known as inference, on servers from Google and Amazon. Those inference costs were 23% higher than the company had anticipated, the projections showed.

    <title>The Briefing: Oracle’s Dividend Question</title>
    <description>%title% 


  The Briefing
  By Martin Peers
  Jan 21, 2026

    Greetings!Here’s a question: How much are big tech companies cutting back on sending money to shareholders as they ramp up their AI development spending? It’s a good time to ask: On Friday, Oracle is due to pay out its latest quarterly dividend of 50 cents a share. That will amount to $1.4 billion going out the door, which Oracle can ill afford. After all, the software and cloud firm burned through $10 billion in cash in the second quarter, thanks to a big increase in capital expenditures related to its AI cloud expansion.And the financial pressure on Oracle is only going to intensify. In the fiscal year that ends in May, analysts estimate it will burn $22.9 billion in cash, according to S&amp;amp;P Global Market Intelligence. That compares with the $900 million cash burn it sustained last fiscal year and is a big switch from the $11.8 billion in free cash flow it produced in fiscal 2024. Analysts are currently projecting Oracle will continue burning cash until fiscal 2029. Cutting the dividend, at least for a few years, would be a smart way to save cash. At the current payout rate, Oracle’s dividend will cost $5.7 billion this fiscal year, up from $4.7 billion last fiscal year. Oracle in the past couple of years has slashed the money it spends buying back stock, one of the other ways companies return money to shareholders. As recently as 2021, Oracle repurchased $21 billion, an amount that shrank to just $600 million in fiscal 2025. Its dividend, in contrast, has risen 56% in that time period! Because Oracle is borrowing money to cover its cash shortfall, it is effectively borrowing more than it would if it suspended the dividend. Perhaps it will decide to cut off the dividend when it reports earnings in a few weeks, but there’s a couple of reasons why it likely won’t.One is that co-founder and executive chair Larry Ellison is the biggest individual recipient of the dividend. He owns about 40.6% of the stock. As a result, he will earn about $2.3 billion of the dividend this year. That money surely comes in handy to support his lifestyle and perhaps to pay the interest on the loans he has taken out against his Oracle stock. Ellison is financially backing his son David’s $108 billion takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery right now: Cutting off the dividend could be problematic for the family. The other argument against a dividend cut is that there are some investment funds that only invest in dividend-paying stocks. Suspending the dividend could prompt those investors to sell Oracle, putting more pressure on its stock price. Still, for Oracle, whether to continue sending billions out the door on the dividend is a question that deserves more scrutiny.Better Late Than NeverApple is finally taking action to compete for AI-interested consumers. The Information today scooped the news that Apple is developing an AI-powered wearable pin the size of an AirTag that will be equipped with a couple of cameras, a speaker and microphones—allowing it to take pictures, videos and audio from a user’s surroundings. Apple is moving quickly on the device in hopes of releasing it by 2027—ensuring that it can compete with OpenAI, which hopes to come out with the first of its AI-powered devices before then.Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Apple plans to revamp Siri by turning it into an AI chatbot, running on an AI model developed by Google. The Siri plans, combined with the AI hardware, should position Apple to compete more effectively as AI becomes more mainstream—and without spending the hundreds of billions other companies are forking out for AI.Today on The Information’s TITVCheck out our latest episode of TITV in which we talk about the future of Netflix&apos;s ad business  In Other News

Barret Zoph, the Thinking Machines Lab cofounder who rejoined OpenAI in a swirl of controversy last week, will lead the company’s push to sell AI products to businesses, as part of a broader reorganization across the company, OpenAI’s CEO of Applications Fidji Simo told staff on Wednesday.

Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, will transition out of leading product and engineering for OpenAI’s business of selling to other enterprises but will continue to run OpenAI’s commercial functions, according to a copy of the memo seen by The Information.

It was thrilling to describe something in plain English and watch an app appear,
less thrilling when the apps were always broken in some way, often full of
maddening bugs. So he set his app creation ambitions aside until technology
caught up with them.

Here are some of the themes they touch on:


HOW WILKINSON USES AI IN HIS WORK AND PERSONAL LIFE

Wilkinson has wired AI into nearly every corner of his day. Here’s what that
looks like:

AN AI THAT KNOWS YOUR RELATIONSHIP INSIDE OUT—AND PREDICTS YOUR FIGHTS

After talking with his girlfriend about how nice it would be to have a GPT
trained on their relationship, Wilkinson used Claude Code to build Deep
Personality, a web app that functions as an AI relationship counselor and
personality analyzer.

He started by asking AI what a therapist would want to know to get a complete
picture of a couple. The response was a list of roughly 20 clinically validated
tests and personality inventories—the kind typically gated by paywalls, and
sometimes only known to therapists. He then used Claude Code to build a simple
interface that consolidates all these tests into a 40-minute multiple-choice
assessment. Claude even wrote the website copy—which impressed Dan, no small
feat—after Wilkinson referenced 37signals cofounder Jason Fried
[https://every.to/emails/click/ed86a33a35e615cf1fcbce2979112d7acd5c92bfb325300a311a43694ae80c4a/eyJzdWJqZWN0Ijoi8J-OpyBPcHVzIDQuNSBDaGFuZ2VkIEhvdyBBbmRyZXcgV2lsa2luc29uIFdvcmtzIGFuZCBMaXZlcyIsInBvc3RfaWQiOjM5MDYsInBvc3RfdHlwZSI6InBvc3QiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2V2ZXJ5LnRvL3BvZGNhc3Qvd2hhdC1qYXNvbi1mcmllZC1sZWFybmVkLWZyb20tMjYteWVhcnMtb2YtYnVpbGRpbmctZ3JlYXQtcHJvZHVjdHMiLCJwb3NpdGlvbiI6Mjd9]

a book premised on the idea that you have just one shot to capture someone’s
attention, in his prompt. The whole site, he estimates, took about two hours to
build.

After an individual completes the assessment, Deep Personality delivers a
45-page analysis that covers personality traits (including nuances like
attachment style
[https://every.to/emails/click/ed86a33a35e615cf1fcbce2979112d7acd5c92bfb325300a311a43694ae80c4a/eyJzdWJqZWN0Ijoi8J-OpyBPcHVzIDQuNSBDaGFuZ2VkIEhvdyBBbmRyZXcgV2lsa2luc29uIFdvcmtzIGFuZCBMaXZlcyIsInBvc3RfaWQiOjM5MDYsInBvc3RfdHlwZSI6InBvc3QiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2xhYnMucHN5Y2hvbG9neS5pbGxpbm9pcy5lZHUvfnJjZnJhbGV5L2F0dGFjaG1lbnQuaHRtIiwicG9zaXRpb24iOjI5fQ==]),
relationship dynamics, ideal jobs, and personal challenges. It also generates
custom prompts users can feed into ChatGPT or Claude to create a personalized
virtual therapist, plus “cards” summarizing how to best work with them, useful
to share with a partner, your boss, or colleagues.

When both partners complete the assessment, the app can analyze them together,
generating a “relationship blueprint” that maps compatibility and predicted
conflicts. “We were reading it out together and just laughing our heads off,”
Wilkinson says, “because it was all the things we fight about perfectly laid
out.” He’s since used it during actual disagreements to surface the deeper
emotional triggers beneath surface-level arguments, helping build empathy by
articulating what’s really at stake for each person.

BUILD A CUSTOM EMAIL CLIENT WITH CLAUDE CODE

Wilkinson receives 200 to 300 emails a day. Managing his inbox used to require
one full-time assistant, sometimes two, plus hours of his own time. He likens
the experience to the classic scene
[https://every.to/emails/click/ed86a33a35e615cf1fcbce2979112d7acd5c92bfb325300a311a43694ae80c4a/eyJzdWJqZWN0Ijoi8J-OpyBPcHVzIDQuNSBDaGFuZ2VkIEhvdyBBbmRyZXcgV2lsa2luc29uIFdvcmtzIGFuZCBMaXZlcyIsInBvc3RfaWQiOjM5MDYsInBvc3RfdHlwZSI6InBvc3QiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PU5rUTU4STUzbWprIiwicG9zaXRpb24iOjMwfQ==]
from the sitcom I Love Lucy
[https://every.to/emails/click/ed86a33a35e615cf1fcbce2979112d7acd5c92bfb325300a311a43694ae80c4a/eyJzdWJqZWN0Ijoi8J-OpyBPcHVzIDQuNSBDaGFuZ2VkIEhvdyBBbmRyZXcgV2lsa2luc29uIFdvcmtzIGFuZCBMaXZlcyIsInBvc3RfaWQiOjM5MDYsInBvc3RfdHlwZSI6InBvc3QiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2VuLndpa2lwZWRpYS5vcmcvd2lraS9JX0xvdmVfTHVjeSIsInBvc2l0aW9uIjozMX0=],
where the protagonist, Lucy, scrambles to keep up with the flow of chocolates on
a conveyor belt in a factory. In other words, Wilkinson felt overwhelmed, like
he was always playing catch-up.

He’d already built an automation using Lindy
[https://every.to/emails/click/ed86a33a35e615cf1fcbce2979112d7acd5c92bfb325300a311a43694ae80c4a/eyJzdWJqZWN0Ijoi8J-OpyBPcHVzIDQuNSBDaGFuZ2VkIEhvdyBBbmRyZXcgV2lsa2luc29uIFdvcmtzIGFuZCBMaXZlcyIsInBvc3RfaWQiOjM5MDYsInBvc3RfdHlwZSI6InBvc3QiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5saW5keS5haS8iLCJwb3NpdGlvbiI6MzJ9],
a platform for creating AI agents, that helped: Every incoming email gets
processed based on its content—sales and marketing messages get archived
automatically, and relevant emails get forwarded to the right person on his
team. That alone cut his email load by about 50 percent. The system also
generated choose-your-own-adventure responses: If someone emailed asking to
meet, the agent would summarize who they were and what they wanted, then give
Wilkinson options to pick from. After he picked one, the agent would send out a
friendly, fully-written response on his behalf.

But edge cases kept tripping him up. He wanted more intricate control, like the
ability to tweak drafts, and handle more complex emails himself. Finally, he
turned to Claude Code: “I just said, ‘Here’s my Gmail credentials, I want you to
build an email triager, here’s how I want it to work.’”

What came back was a simple, web-based email client. It surfaces emails that
require a response, ranks them by priority and sender, and offers two modes:
multiple choice for quick replies, or an interface for complex emails that asks
Wilkinson a series of questions before drafting a response. Within a week, he
was using it daily. “Anyone who’s technical knows how astounding that is,” he
says, “and how frustrating it is to build an email client. It blows my freaking
mind.”

The same automation handles a different kind of inbox overwhelm: school emails.
Any parent knows the deluge of field trips, permission slips, special lunch
days, and early dismissals that inundate their inboxes. Wilkinson’s system
ingests all of it and texts him what he actually needs to know: “Heads up, Peter
needs a packed lunch tomorrow,” along with, say, a link to sign the field trip
form. Relevant dates also get added to his parenting calendar automatically.

AN AI THAT WATCHES YOUR BACK IN MEETINGS

Wilkinson has also built himself something like an AI referee for the
complicated human dynamics at play at work. It’s a custom Lindy agent that
records his meetings and produces notes, but the feature he cares about most is
a kind of psychological pattern detection.

After each meeting, his agent analyzes the transcript and texts him if it finds
any red flags in the interaction. For example, he recently had a tense call with
a contractor who’d missed a deadline. Wilkinson held him accountable, calmly,
but the contractor flipped the script—accusing him of being rude, which made him
feel like the problem. Wilkinson left the call doubting himself. A moment later,
his phone buzzed: The agent had detected the contractor using manipulative
tactics like gaslighting.

When Dan pushes him on AI’s tendency to agree with whatever you signal in your
prompt, Wilkinson says the key is being careful not to inject your opinion into
the prompt and defining a high bar for the AI ahead of time. The threshold for
Wilkinson’s agent is: “You have to analyze every single word in this thing, and
you only flag it if it reaches a critical point.” Wilkinson compares the
practice to reading body language—useful data, but only in context, and never
the whole picture. “I probably wouldn’t make a hire or fire decision entirely on
that,” he says, “but it will often confirm a feeling.”

YOUR PERSONAL STYLIST IS A PROMPT AWAY

Like a lot of guys, Wilkinson says, he wanted to dress well but didn’t
understand color theory or what looked good on him. His solution was to build an
AI version of the computer used by the protagonist in the 1995 movie Clueless
[https://every.to/emails/click/ed86a33a35e615cf1fcbce2979112d7acd5c92bfb325300a311a43694ae80c4a/eyJzdWJqZWN0Ijoi8J-OpyBPcHVzIDQuNSBDaGFuZ2VkIEhvdyBBbmRyZXcgV2lsa2luc29uIFdvcmtzIGFuZCBMaXZlcyIsInBvc3RfaWQiOjM5MDYsInBvc3RfdHlwZSI6InBvc3QiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbWRiLmNvbS90aXRsZS90dDAxMTI2OTcvIiwicG9zaXRpb24iOjMzfQ==]
that automatically matches her outfits.

Every morning at 7 a.m., his automation checks the weather in Victoria, British
Columbia, where he lives, and pulls from a Google Sheet called “Andrew’s
Wardrobe”—a spreadsheet he created by photographing all his clothes and having
Claude convert it into a CSV. The system generates four outfit recommendations,
renders them using Google DeepMind’s image generator Nano Banana, and texts him
the results via communications tool Twilio. It tells him what to wear, right
down to which watch he should accessorize with. He’s also built a custom GPT he
can query on the fly—snap a photo of some jeans and ask what goes with them, or
get advice like “French tuck that shirt.”


WHY YOU NEED TO FIND A MOAT THAT ISN’T CODE

As much as Wilkinson loves building with AI, it’s changed how he thinks about
buying businesses, and Tiny has slowed the pace of its acquisitions

His analogy: Imagine someone invents a machine that makes incredible pizza, and
anyone can buy it, which means that anyone can make great pizza. Consumers
benefit from better, cheaper pizza everywhere, but business owners will get
squeezed as their margins collapse. They have no way to compete when everyone
can make the same quality. According to him, this dynamic is currently playing
out in software. The old moat in software was that programming was hard to
learn, slow to master, and expensive to hire for. Now that AI has made it easy
for non-coders to build, your moat has to come from somewhere else, like brand,
distribution, or hardware. Otherwise, you’re selling pizza in a town where
everyone has that magical machine—not a recipe for long-term success.

&quot;Apple Developing AI Wearable Pin&quot;
By Wayne Ma and Qianer Liu
Jan 21, 2026

Apple is developing an AI-powered wearable pin the size of an AirTag that is equipped with multiple cameras, a speaker, microphones and wireless charging, according to people with direct knowledge of the project. The device could be released as early as 2027, they said.

Such a product would position Apple to compete more effectively with OpenAI, which is planning its own AI-powered devices, and Meta Platforms, which is already selling smart glasses that offer access to its AI assistant.

The transformer architecture, developed by a team of researchers at Google and now widely used across the industry, is featured in 292 papers with authors from Chinese institutions.

Many Chinese-born researchers study in the US, forging bonds with colleagues that last a lifetime. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“NeurIPS itself is an example of international collaboration and a testament to its importance in our field,” Katherine Gorman, a spokesperson for NeurIPS, said in a statement. “Collaborations between students and advisors often continue long after the student has left their university.

After writing a script to download all the papers, I used the model to dip into each one and do some analysis. This involved having Codex write a script to search for US and Chinese institutions in the author field of each paper. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The experiment offered a fascinating glimpse into the potential for coding models to automate useful chores. There’s plenty of panic about AI replacing coding jobs, but this is something that I normally wouldn’t have had the time or budget to build. I started out writing scripts and having Codex modify them before just asking Codex to do the analysis itself. This involved the model importing Python libraries, testing different tools, and writing scripts before producing reports for me to vet. The process involved a fair bit of trial and error, and you have to be very careful, because AI models make surprisingly stupid mistakes even when they’re being quite smart. I had to make sure that each report included a way for me to go through the results, and I checked as many as possible manually.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;row row-8&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;

The company’s world-making model, called Waypoint-1, can take a text prompt and turn it into a scene that you can move through and interact with. Louis Castricato, cofounder and CEO of Over World, let me try it out before today’s launch. I tried several gritty sci-fi scenes before asking Over World to generate “chicken world.” This produced a bizarre feathery realm in which one could throw eggs. The scenes do not remain coherent for very long, but Castricato says the first model is just a proof of concept to show how AI could revolutionize video game design.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;● A team from Peking University and the Beijing Institute for Artificial General Intelligence has devised an interesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.wired.com/external/43650261.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&quot; style=&quot;color:#098000; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;new way for models to keep learning&lt;/a&gt; even after their initial training run. They used an approach called Parametric Skill Transfer to modify the weights of a model. This makes it possible to “inject” a skill learned through reinforcement learning (RL)—like using an email client—into a model without going through the costly process of performing RL each time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;● A team at Stanford University and Nvidia led by Fei-Fei Li recently demo’d &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.wired.com/external/43650261.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&quot; style=&quot;color:#098000; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Point World&lt;/a&gt;, a 3-D world model that predicts how a robot’s movements will affect a scene using incomplete imagery captured by conventional cameras.

Remarkably, an industrial robot arm equipped with Point World is able to perform various basic physical tasks like pushing objects around without any post-training, and with just a few images as input.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;row row-10&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;

Previous research has involved using an LLM as a dungeon master, but the new effort involves the models also controlling players and monsters across many turns of combat. The models played against each other along with more than 2,000 experienced D&amp;D players. “In D&amp;D you have this sort of ability to verify the effects of what the LLM does in the game world,” Zhu says. “D&amp;D just gives us a really great test bed.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zhu adds that his research is not aimed at replacing humans. “My personal opinion is that D&amp;D is a very human game, and replacing the DM or players with AI might lose the point of that,” he says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the more fascinating (and unexpected) results was how different characters exhibited oddly colorful personalities. Goblins came up with their own slang (“Shiny man’s gonna bleed,”) paladins went off on heroic monologues, and warlocks became overly dramatic. As someone who has played a bit of D&amp;D, I can tell you that this seems extremely realistic for some players I know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;row row-15&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot;

    <title>Data Center Inflation Is Here</title>
    <description>%title% 


  The Information Finance
  By Ken Brown
  Jan 21, 2026

    In the first weeks of the year, it has become clear that building data centers is getting more expensive. On a relative basis, the shift could benefit the cash-rich tech giants, particularly Google, while potentially hurting cash-burning startups. This doesn’t mean giant data centers won’t get built. Investors are still enthusiastic about AI, and the tech giants that are funding the buildout are still rolling in cash. It could mean these companies see lower returns and some projects don’t get built or are scaled back. The biggest and hardest-to-quantify cost is power, which has long been a major constraint on data center construction. Local governments have been complaining for more than a year about rising electricity costs, and the White House, which has woken up to concerns about affordability, weighed in.Last week, the Department of Energy and several governors in the middle Atlantic region effectively demanded that companies building data centers agree to 15-year contracts to buy power from new power plants. Auctions for power run by grid operator PJM have hit records, but the prices haven’t been high enough to get power companies to build new power generation. That means data center developers will have to spend more. The notably bipartisan effort is expected to generate $15 billion in new power plants. Both Google and Microsoft appear committed to delivering their own power. As my colleague Ann Davis Vaughan wrote in our new AI Infrastructure newsletter, Google’s $4.8 billion purchase of power producer Intersect will speed its data center development. We also reported that Google is asking federal regulators to speed approval of data centers that bring their own power. Microsoft said last week it would pay more for electricity and subsidize the expansion of the electric grid. Electric power means computing power and that could become the differentiator among AI companies. Those that can afford to build it will move ahead and those that can’t fall will fall behind. Computing power translates into revenue, a connection made clear by OpenAI’s chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, over the weekend. The company’s computing capacity roughly tripled in each of the last three years and so did its revenue. If power was the only higher cost, it could be manageable. But there are others. Financing could get more expensive for two reasons. First, long-term interest rates hit their highest levels in more than four months this week, driven in part by President Donald Trump’s tariff threats, tied to his obsession with taking over Greenland. Second, there will be an estimated $300 billion of AI debt issuance this year. While a lot of it will come from the tech giants, which have pristine credit, the sheer amount of borrowing could outweigh demand. That means yields could rise, making borrowing more expensive. The weight of that more costly debt will fall on the companies with less pristine credit, such as Oracle or CoreWeave. (There’s another more wonky way to think about it: Investors buy up the super-safe debt issued by the tech giants and sell off generally lower yielding U.S. government debt, which drives up interest rates for the rest of the economy.)Then there are the costs of the gear needed to build data centers. You can start with commodities such as copper, which rose 45% last year. Demand for the metal is expected to keep growing over the next decade. AI data centers use far more copper than typical data centers do, for everything from electrical wires and components to cooling systems and servers. Then there’s the manufactured goods. The wait time for new natural gas turbines is three to four years, making it a terrific seller’s market. That’s one reason companies such as GE Vernova are raising prices. The company has boosted margins and expects profits to grow as price increases flow through its order book. GE Vernova lifted its dividend, boosted share buybacks and is generating piles of cash. Its stock was among the market’s best performers last year.The wait time for gas turbines is just one of many factors causing delays for data centers, as my colleague Anissa Gardizy, who also writes the AI Infrastructure newsletter, reported. There have been delays installing water-cooling systems, which Nvidia’s superfast chips require, and delays getting those chips up and running. There have also been delays connecting to the power grid and getting local approval.The longer it takes to open a data center, the more it will cost and the harder it will be to earn a return on that investment. I’m focusing on rising costs right now because I think their impact will start showing up this year. In extreme cases, developers will be squeezed for cash and might need to raise money to finish their projects. Higher costs might also make some cancel planned projects before they get off the ground.As we saw with OpenAI, more computing capacity means more revenue. Those who can’t pay will fall behind.

And now, on with the show. Here’s Justine:
2025 was the year of video. AI-generated ads went mainstream. Launch videos from seed stage startups got millions of views. Video podcasts and interviews exploded.
What you didn’t see was all the work behind the scenes. Cutting 90 minutes of footage into a three-minute short. Correcting lighting and audio in post-production because you couldn’t nail it in the shoot. Searching for the right music and sound effects.
A common rule of thumb in video production is that you’ll spend 80% of your time &amp; energy on editing, and 20% on filming (or now, generating). Crafting compelling video is typically a long and tedious process – and few people have the “taste” to do it right. There’s a significant barrier to entry.
We now have the technology to hand over some of this work to AI agents, which can help us produce both filmed and generated content. Vision models can watch and comprehend massive amounts of video footage. Agents can analyze, plan, and use editing tools on your behalf. And we have enough training data to teach models what makes a video great.
Video agents will blow out the supply curve for quality video – the kind of content that requires days (or weeks) from professional video editors today. What Cursor did for coding, these agents will do for video production.
Why now?
There’s immense demand for agents that give anyone the skills (and taste) of a professional video editor. So why don’t these products already exist? There have been a few recent developments that have unlocked progress here:
Vision models can now process large amounts of video. You have to understand video before you can edit it. This is a non-trivial challenge - there’s a lot of information to process, even in a short clip. We’ve seen a lot of progress with recent LLMs like Gemini 3, GPT-5.2, Molmo 2, and Vidi2, which are inherently multimodal and have longer context windows. Gemini 3 can now process up to an hour of video! You can upload it as an input and ask the model to generate timestamped labels, find a specific moment, or just summarize what’s happening.
Models can now use tools. AI video editors need to be able to take action - not just describe what’s happening or suggest changes. We’re starting to see meaningful progress around LLMs as real agents that can use tools. One of my favorite examples of this is Claude using Blender [ https://substack.com/redirect/f09d1c5a-ac82-4d47-908d-410f2dbbf1b3?j=eyJ1IjoiNzl6aTlmIn0.vdkyg0_H7i7s7G01Fg-S3H4FqvnSevRAFM-sUjjJ264 ] (a notoriously tricky product that many humans haven’t mastered). You can imagine how this evolves as you give agents access to more tools.
Image and video generation models have improved. I’m a big believer that many video production pipelines will be hybrid - a mix of AI and filmed content. Imagine filming interviews for a documentary, but generating B-roll or historical footage with AI. Or using a motion transfer model to take a reference animation and apply it to a real character. For any of these things to work, models needed to reach a level of quality &amp; consistency to be valuable. Now, that’s finally happening.
What will these agents do? 
A few examples of the types of tasks they’ll be able to tackle for us:
Process - whether you’re filming or generating a video, you’ll likely end up with a lot more footage than you need (sometimes by a factor of hundreds - imagine how many “takes” there are for each scene of a movie or TV show). It’s often a challenge to sort through all this footage, organize it, and decide what to use. Products like Eddie AI [ https://substack.com/redirect/edc55fb8-7170-40a8-bbd5-6bfd0318d822?j=eyJ1IjoiNzl6aTlmIn0.vdkyg0_H7i7s7G01Fg-S3H4FqvnSevRAFM-sUjjJ264 ] can take hours of uploaded video and do things like identifying A-roll vs. B-roll, processing multiple camera angles, and comparing takes.
Orchestrate - if we assume that many videos are going to include some element of AI in the future, we’re going to need agents that orchestrate all of the models. For example - imagine you want to add an AI animation to an educational video. You’ll need an agent that can generate the images, send them to a video model, and stitch the outputs together. Products like Glif [ https://substack.com/redirect/af57bbe4-a34e-4707-803f-6ea3c8163285?j=eyJ1IjoiNzl6aTlmIn0.vdkyg0_H7i7s7G01Fg-S3H4FqvnSevRAFM-sUjjJ264 ] are launching agents that coordinate between multiple models on a user’s behalf.
Polish - fixing the small details often end up taking a video from good to great. But if you’re not a professional video editor, you may be overwhelmed by the flood of little tasks needed to polish a video. For example - you may want to adjust lighting between clips, clean noise out of the audio track, or take out filler words (“ummms” and “uhhhs”) during an interview. Products like Descript [ https://substack.com/redirect/410319ab-e038-4ee4-942f-d4e5a3ddbbf2?j=eyJ1IjoiNzl6aTlmIn0.vdkyg0_H7i7s7G01Fg-S3H4FqvnSevRAFM-sUjjJ264 ]’s Underlord agent can take a video, make all these changes for you, and deliver the final version.
Adapt - when you make a good video, it often makes sense to adapt it for more reach. For example, you may want to cut a YouTube podcast into short clips with different aspect ratios to post on your X, Instagram, and TikTok accounts. Or even translate a video into other languages (and re-dub the speakers) to reach an international audience. Platforms like Overlap [ https://substack.com/redirect/61bf66eb-72df-410d-94b3-6f3329ad846b?j=eyJ1IjoiNzl6aTlmIn0.vdkyg0_H7i7s7G01Fg-S3H4FqvnSevRAFM-sUjjJ264 ] allow you to set up node workflows for these adaptation tasks.
Optimize - the ultimate goal isn’t just replacing manual tasks with AI. It’s building agents with taste that can make your videos better. There’s a reason people hire professional video editors: they make things look good. They spend years learning everything from how to hook viewers to pacing the storyline and using music to build an emotional reaction. There are thousands of micro-decisions there. YouTuber Emma Chamberlain famously said that she used to spend 30-40 hours editing a ~15 minute vlog.
What if an AI agent could watch your footage, ask about your objectives, and then craft a few draft versions of a video for you to iterate on? You review and direct - “The opening is too slow.” “Cut the middle section.” “Make the ending hit harder” - and the agent executes.
Video has won. It’s how we learn, market, and connect. But the editing bottleneck keeps growing. More footage captured, more platforms to publish on, more formats required.
The good news is that technology to solve this exists. Vision models, tool-using agents, and massive amounts of training data have all matured in the past year. The pieces are in place.
This means that AI editing agents will dramatically increase the quality of all video we see in the coming months and years, along with the rate at which it’s created.
2025 was the year of video. 2026 is the year we let agents edit it.

    <title>AI Agenda: AI Videos Nearly Indistinguishable From Real Videos, Runway Finds</title>
    <description>%title% 


  AI Agenda
  By Rocket Drew
  Jan 21, 2026

    Hello! Rocket here.Runway today is releasing its latest AI model, Gen-4.5, that can generate videos from an image. The model, from the startup that specializes in image and video-generating models, is impressive but is likely to underscore growing concerns about AI-generated deepfakes.To measure the model’s performance, Runway asked over 1,000 people to distinguish real videos from similar videos generated by the model. Participants only guessed correctly 57.1% of the time—not much better than flipping a coin. Runway came up with the test when its own employees started having a hard time telling apart videos based on digital footage from the outputs of the new model, said Chief Technology Officer Anastasis Germanidis. “We have probably some of the most trained eyes,” he said, so if Runway’s employees were struggling with the task, they figured people who don’t spend their days scrutinizing AI videos would fare even worse.Runway used its new model to generate a video from the starting frame of clips of real subjects, like animals and human faces. The clips came from Filmpac, a provider of video footage and other media. Runway then trimmed the real and AI videos to five seconds and made sure both had the same resolution.Participants in the study had 10 seconds to guess whether a clip was real or AI-generated. The short time window is realistic, simulating how someone might encounter a video on social media.Germanidis himself took a stab at it. The result? “I failed quite a bit,” he said. In the study, people did a better job on videos that contained human faces and hands, or humans taking actions. For those videos, accuracy ranged from 58% to 65%. It’s not that the model is worse at generating those videos: Germanidis thinks people are more attuned to videos of people that look “uncanny,” compared to other subjects.Well before Runway’s latest model, lawmakers and some technologists were worried about the threat from deepfakes, or AI-generated videos and images that pretend to be legitimate. Those concerns intensified this month, after xAI’s Grok generated images of women and children wearing bikinis or lingerie, prompting bans in multiple countries and an investigation by the California attorney general.To guard against misinformation, people should “have a more critical mindset” about the content they see online,” Germanidis said. “For us, the study is a way to kind of increase the awareness that at this point we’re crossing the threshold, and it’s hard to tell apart generated from real videos.”Runway includes in the metadata of its videos that they are AI-generated and is also looking into more reliable ways to watermark these videos, so they can be identified as AI-generated, Germanidis said. Congress has proposed legislation to require watermarking of AI-generated content, and some states have passed laws requiring such disclosures. In Germanidis’ view, the technology is too early to codify specific requirements, but he noted that policies dealing with misinformation in general should cover AI-generated videos.In the U.S., the 2024 presidential election came and went without significant disruption from AI-fueled disinformation, but Runway’s study is just the latest evidence that the quality of AI models has improved a lot over the past two years. With midterm elections coming up in November, our collective ability to sort fact from fiction will be tested again.If you want to prepare in the meantime, anyone is free to try their hand at a Turing test on Runway’s website, where the company will be launching a version available to the public, along with a leaderboard to track who can most accurately determine what’s AI-generated and what’s not.Here’s what else is going on…People on the MoveAmazon has tapped former Microsoft executive Jigar Thakkar to lead Quick Suite, a collection of enterprise search and agent-building tools it launched in October as part of a broader push to develop compelling AI applications.Greg Yang, a co-founder of xAI said in a post on X that he’s stepping back into an informal advisory role to go “founder mode” on his health, following a diagnosis for Lyme disease. “Until I pushed myself hard building xAI and weakened my immune system, the symptoms weren&apos;t noticeable.”Overheard“Don’t let your loved ones use ChatGPT,” Elon Musk posted on X on Tuesday, in reference to a post about ChatGPT users who committed suicide. The post followed another on Monday, in which Musk wrote “OpenAI’s ChatGPT convinced a guy to do a murder-suicide! To be safe, AI must be maximally truthful-seeking and not pander to delusions.”In response, Altman wrote Tuesday that “we need to protect vulnerable users, while also making sure our guardrails still allow all of our users to benefit from our tools.” He also said that Musk had previously complained about ChatGPT’s moderation being too restrictive. “Apparently more than 50 people have died from crashes related to Autopilot. I only ever rode in a car using it once, some time ago, but my first thought was that it was far from a safe thing for Tesla to have released. I won’t even start on some of the Grok decisions,” Altman wrote.Meanwhile, at Davos, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said he would be open to a détente in the AI race. In an interview with Bloomberg, Hassabis said would likely support a pause on AI development if every AI company agreed to it. He said he would like to see companies collaborate on AI development as they approach the creation of human-level AI, but unfortunately “international cooperation’s a little bit tricky at the moment.” Presumably, such a pause would also ease tensions between the CEOs of those companies on social media!Policy WatchAnthropic has hired three new lobbying firms since the beginning of December, Politico reported, citing recent disclosures. The firms are Thorn Run Partners, Kountoupes Denham Carr &amp;amp; Reid and Avenue Solutions.Anthropic spent over $1 million in lobbying expenditures in the third quarter last year, Politico reported. That’s more than OpenAI spent in that period, but less than Meta or Amazon.Deals and DebutsSee The Information’s Generative AI Database for an exclusive list of private companies and their investors.Zipline, a drone delivery startup, raised over $600 million at a $7.6 billion valuation, in a funding round from investors including Valor Equity Partners, Tiger Global, Fidelity Management and Research Company and Baillie Gifford.Humans&amp;amp;, which is developing “human-centric” AI tools, raised $480 million at $4.48 billion valuation in a seed funding round led by SV Angel and co-founder Georges Harik, with participation from Nvidia, Jeff Bezos, GV, Emerson Collective, Forerunner, S32, DCVC, Human Capital, Felicis and CRV.Baseten, which helps run AI models for companies including Cursor and Notion, raised $300 million at a $5 billion valuation in a funding round led by IVP and CapitalG, with participation from Nvidia, which invested $150 million, the Wall Street Journal reported.OpenEvidence, which provides a “ChatGPT for doctors,” raised $250 million in funding at a $12 billion valuation led by Thrive Capital and DST Global. The Information first broke the round here.Emergent, which provides AI for developing apps, raised $70 million in a Series B funding round at a $300 million valuation led by Khosla Ventures and SoftBank.Applied Compute, which uses reinforcement learning to customize AI models, is in talks to raise up to $70 million at a $1.3 billion valuation, The Information reported. Kleiner Perkins is in talks to lead the round.Datarails, which offers AI-powered FP&amp;amp;A software, raised $70 million in Series C funding led by One Peak.Ivo, which uses AI to help lawyers review contracts, raised $55 million in a Series B funding round led by Blackbird.Unbox Robotics, which develops warehouse robots, raised $28 million in a Series B funding round led by Icici Venture and Restart Labs.OpenAI is asking a small group of advertisers for spending commitments of less than $1 million each over a several week trial period, as the company tests new ads within its ChatGPT chatbot, The Information reported.OpenAI also began adding age verification to ChatGPT. If OpenAI estimates that a user is under 18, ChatGPT adds additional restrictions, including on violence and romantic roleplay.ServiceNow has signed a multi-year deal to pay for OpenAI’s artificial intelligence models in its business software, the two companies said on Tuesday. Under the agreement, OpenAI will now be the “preferred” AI model provider in ServiceNow’s software. In the past, ServiceNow let customers choose between AI models from OpenAI or other providers including Google and Anthropic.Amazon is open to working with other companies to run their AI shopping assistants on its site, where it already offers its own shopping chatbot, CEO Andy Jassy said in an interview with The Information’s Jessica Lessin at the World Economic Forum in Davos.X released the algorithm it uses to recommend posts in users’ For You feeds. The algorithm ranks posts using “a Grok-based transformer model that predicts engagement probabilities for each post.”72% of ChatGPT subscribers have set ChatGPT to their browser homepage, replacing traditional search engines, according to a survey conducted by Bango, a subscription bundling company.Adobe released new AI features in Acrobat, such as the ability to generate podcast summaries based on files, create presentations and edit files using prompts.

 DEEPMIND CEO SAYS CHINESE AI FIRMS ARE 6 MONTHS BEHIND THE WEST (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google DeepMind&apos;s CEO, Demis Hassabis, says that Chinese AI companies
remain around six months behind the frontier AI of the leading Western
labs. He says the response to DeepSeek&apos;s R1 model last year was a
massive overreaction and that while Chinese firms are very good at
catching up to the frontier, they have yet to show they can innovate
beyond that. Some of the barriers to Chinese AI development are set to
come down as the Trump administration is easing a ban on advanced AI
chip exports to China. Sales of the most advanced AI processors will
remain blocked on national security grounds.

 Those paying for LLM APIs and have never tested alternatives are
likely overpaying. There are almost always cheaper options with
comparable quality for every workflow. Benchmarking and finding an
optimal model is a complex process, but it can result in significant
savings. This post discusses how one team navigated the process to
save thousands of dollars. 

 THE TRAGEDY OF THE AGENTIC COMMONS (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI agents can improve matching markets, like dating or job searches,
by using LLMs to convert unstructured preferences into actionable
data, outperforming standard questionnaires. However, in markets where
everyone uses AI agents, congestion increases significantly, reducing
efficiency without a pricing mechanism. Introducing prices and
institutional design can alleviate congestion, streamline
coordination, and enhance market efficiency.

 ANTHROPIC CEO: SELLING H200S TO CHINA IS LIKE GIVING NUKES TO NORTH
KOREA (4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has likened the decision to allow Nvidia
to sell GPUs to Chinese companies to giving nuclear weapons to an
adversary. The Trump administration announced just over a month ago
that it would allow shipments of Nvidia H200 accelerators to Chinese
customers as long as the US received 25% of the revenues. Chinese
authorities have yet to allow local buyers to acquire the GPUs.
Anthropic wants stricter controls on AI exports, saying access to the
chips would put Chinese model developers in a better position to
compete with the West.

&quot;TikTok Plans Big Shopping Push&quot;
By Jing Yang and Juro Osawa
Jan 21, 2026

TikTok’s U.S. business may be about to take off.

The scheduled completion this week of TikTok’s sale of its U.S. data security arm to a joint venture ends years of uncertainty about its future in the U.S. And the video app maker is now redoubling its efforts to build a much bigger e-commerce business in the U.S., in a new challenge to Amazon.

 TLDR FOUNDERS 2026-01-21

📈 

HEADLINES &amp; TRENDS

 WHY ONE THIRD OF ALL STARTUPS ARE SOLO FOUNDED (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Solo founders now launch 36% of new startups, up from under 25% in
2019, marking the first time in over 50 years that a single founder
builds more than a third of new companies. AI tools let one person
handle coding, design, marketing, analytics, and support, enabling
solo founders to compete with multi-person teams. Investors are
increasingly backing solo founders because singular decision-making
preserves “authorship,” creating coherent products and faster
execution while avoiding co-founder conflicts. 

 MODEL-MARKET FIT (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Product-market fit has a prerequisite most AI founders ignore. Before
the market can pull your product, the model has to actually be capable
of doing the job. Legal AI was stuck for years until GPT-4 crossed the
threshold, then minted more unicorns in 18 months than the previous
decade. You can tell when MMF is missing by how human-in-the-loop gets
positioned. When it exists, human oversight is a feature. When it
doesn&apos;t, it&apos;s a crutch. The dangerous zone is betting on capability
that&apos;s 24-36 months away. 

🧠 

STRATEGIES &amp; TACTICS

 MASTERING COLD EMAIL (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Cold email still works, otherwise nobody would be doing it. The
problem is that most people only understand adding volume when they
should focus on messaging potency. For less than $1,000, you can
personalize emails to 10,000 people in a day. The key insight is
rethinking your offer because demos are dead. Nobody has time for them
anymore. The best offers are valuable to the user, aligned with what
you actually sell, and filter for good-fit customers. 

 PERSONAL LAND-MINES DETERMINE STARTUP FAILURE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The biggest reason startups fail isn&apos;t market timing, competition, or
tech risk, it&apos;s the founder&apos;s personal life. Divorce, co-founder
breakups, substance issues, or shifting priorities are consistent
“land-mines” that end companies. Early-stage investing isn&apos;t just
underwriting an idea. It&apos;s underwriting a human over a long,
unpredictable journey. Founder durability and momentum through life&apos;s
pressures may matter more than almost any other factor in startup
success.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY EVERY EXEC SHOULD BE VIBECODING (14 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The role of leadership is changing. Pure leadership and management
are no longer a full-time job. The future will see more seniors and
executives working as part-time individual contributors. Vibecoding is
a great way to experience the balance. Company leaders can&apos;t afford to
miss out on this skillset. 

 THE COMMODITIZATION OF SERVICES (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Before electrification, light was scarce and expensive. When it
became cheap, people stopped thinking about the cost of turning on a
switch. We&apos;re at the same moment with AI agents. Services that cost
hundreds of thousands will cost tens to hundreds. The current agency
model and vertical SaaS both rely on friction that&apos;s disappearing. If
the cost of production drops to near zero, price must follow.

 SCALING TEAMS: PEOPLE, PROJECTS, AND PROCESS (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Good scaling requires thoughtfully addressing the specific
constraints a team is facing, evolving approaches as the team and
organization change, and always keeping the focus on people and
delivering value effectively. 

 THE POSTMODERN DATA STACK IS AI (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The modern data stack works brilliantly for structured data, but
businesses thrive on unstructured data, something AI excels in.

 BEING A PLATFORM ENGINEER IN 2026: CAREER REALITY CHECK (5 MINUTE

 Platform engineering transitioned into an industrial standard by
2025, enabling mature organizations to achieve 20:1
developer-to-platform-engineer ratios and halve time-to-market.
Average salaries, now at $160,000 in North America and $104,000 in

 WHAT AI IS ACTUALLY GOOD FOR, ACCORDING TO DEVELOPERS (5 MINUTE READ)

 This post discusses AI coding tools designed to protect developer
flow with contextual, customizable help rather than chat-centered
automation, prioritizing human judgment, learning, minimal

without disrupting creativity. 

 UNCONVENTIONAL POSTGRESQL OPTIMIZATIONS (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Unconventional PostgreSQL techniques such as constraint_exclusion,
function-based indexes on lower-cardinality expressions, virtual
generated columns, and hash-backed exclusion constraints can
significantly reduce query execution time, index size, and unnecessary
full-table scans. These approaches outperform standard full-table
scans and B-tree indexing in analytics-heavy and ad-hoc query
workloads by better aligning indexes and constraints with actual query
needs.

 MAKING VERY SMALL LLMS SMARTER WITH RAG (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Small, local LLMs can be effectively leveraged for niche development

 IP ADDRESSES THROUGH 2025 (45 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 IPv4 is effectively “post-exhaustion” by 2025: the globally
allocated public pool is flat to slightly shrinking (~3.687B allocated
at end-2025, down ~237k on the year), remaining free space sits mostly
in APNIC/AFRINIC, and scarcity is managed via NAT/CGNAT plus an
active—but cooling—transfer market whose prices fell sharply
through 2025. IPv6 keeps growing in deployment, but 2025 saw fewer and
much smaller allocations (big drop in total /32s allocated), and the
Internet&apos;s trajectory is still shaped by the client/server + NAT model
rather than a return to universal, publicly reachable end hosts.

ARTICLES &amp; TUTORIALS

 HOW HIGHTOUCH BUILT THEIR LONG-RUNNING AGENT HARNESS (15 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Hightouch developed an AI marketing agent capable of complex,
multi-step tasks. Its team explicitly separated the model&apos;s planning
from its execution, allowing for dynamic plan updates as the agent
learns from data. To manage context, they used &quot;agentic delegation&quot;
through techniques like buffering large data to a temporary filesystem
and spawning dynamic subagents for isolated, complex sub-tasks. 

 UNCONVENTIONAL POSTGRESQL OPTIMIZATIONS (20 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This article goes over some unconventional PostgreSQL optimization
techniques that go beyond standard practices like simple indexing. One
method involves enabling `constraint_exclusion` to remove unnecessary
full table scans when queries contradict existing check constraints.
Another technique optimizes for lower cardinality by creating
function-based indexes (e.g., on just the date part of a timestamp),
which are made consistently usable and efficient with virtual
generated columns.

OPINIONS &amp; ADVICE

 I&apos;M ADDICTED TO BEING USEFUL (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A staff software engineer deeply loves his job despite current
industry stresses because of his addiction to being useful. He gets
satisfaction in work that aligns with his compulsion to solve
problems. His role is perfectly tailored to this, as he feels an
almost physical discomfort until he resolves a technical challenge. 

 AI&apos;S MISSING INGREDIENT (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The current reliance on basic chatbot interfaces underutilizes AI&apos;s
potential. This failure of imagination comes from the absence of
design. AI needs more design expertise to create better products.

LAUNCHES &amp; TOOLS

 ANNOUNCING MASTRA 1.0! (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Mastra, an AI agent framework for TypeScript, has officially
announced the stable release of version 1.0. This version includes
Server Adapters for easier deployment, Composite Storage for flexible
backend configurations, and full support for Vercel&apos;s AI SDK v6. 

 PIPENET (WEBSITE) [14] 

 Pipenet is a modern, open-source alternative to localtunnel that
provides a bundled client and server to host your own secure tunnel
infrastructure. It allows users to expose local services to the
internet, share local development servers, test webhooks, or embed
tunneling capabilities directly into their own applications. 

 WXPATH (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 wxpath is a Python library for declarative web crawling and data
extraction, where traversal and extraction logic are expressed
directly using XPath. It introduces custom XPath operators like
`url(...)` and `///url(...)` to enable deep, breadth-first web graph
exploration within a single expression.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WITHOUT BENCHMARKING LLMS, YOU&apos;RE LIKELY OVERPAYING 5-10X (9 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Many users overpay for LLM API calls because common benchmarks don&apos;t
accurately predict performance or cost-effectiveness for their
specific tasks, leading them to default to popular but expensive
models. This article goes over a benchmarking methodology that
involves collecting real prompts, defining expected outputs, running
numerous LLMs via a unified API, and using an LLM-as-judge to score
responses based on quality, cost, and latency. This process
consistently revealed that many users can achieve comparable quality
at much lower costs, often cutting bills by 80% or more. 

 AI AGENTS AT WORK: REAL-TIME PLATFORM INSIGHTS IN SLACK (8 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Monday.com developed an AI Slack bot to help devs quickly access
real-time platform insights without having to manually check internal
tools or dig through notifications. The bot uses LLM agents connected
to their microservices data through an MCP. To prevent the AI from
hallucinating data, they pre-computed statistics rather than letting
the model calculate them. 

 RUNNING CLAUDE CODE DANGEROUSLY (SAFELY) (6 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The author wanted to use Claude Code with the
`--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag for an improved workflow, but
needed a safe, isolated environment to prevent accidental damage to
their host system. They initially considered Docker, but issues like
Docker-in-Docker requiring privileged mode made it unsuitable for true
sandboxing. They chose Vagrant to create a disposable virtual machine,
which offers full isolation and a reproducible configuration.

 Claude Chill is a PTY proxy that tames Claude Code&apos;s massive terminal
updates by rendering only screen differences, preserving history, and

 WHY AI CODING TOOLS SHIFT THE REAL BOTTLENECK TO REVIEW (8 MINUTE
READ) [20] 

 Through testing identical features built manually versus with AI,
this developer found that AI generates 2-6× more code with extensive
defensive patterns and edge-case handling, changing review questions
from &quot;what&apos;s missing?&quot; to &quot;is all this complexity necessary?&quot; 

 THE CHALLENGES OF SOFT DELETE (10 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 The common `archived_at` column for soft delete has too many
complexities, and instead, alternatives like database triggers should
be considered. 

 THE AGENT SKILLS DIRECTORY (WEBSITE) [22] 

 Skills are reusable, plugin-like capabilities that provide procedural
knowledge to help AI agents more effectively accomplish specific
tasks, and this website is a directory of the most useful skills.

NEWS &amp; TRENDS

 CHATGPT SEARCHES GOOGLE SHOPPING TO CREATE ITS RECOMMENDATIONS (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 ChatGPT&apos;s product carousels are largely shaped by Google Shopping
results. Experiments show that the top recommended items frequently
match high-ranking Google Shopping listings. This means ecommerce
brands that want visibility inside ChatGPT need to prioritize clean
and accurate Google Shopping feeds with up-to-date pricing, titles,
images, and availability rather than focusing only on conversational
SEO. 

 THE 8 MOST INFLUENTIAL CONTENT MARKETING TRENDS FOR 2026 (13 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 The dominant content trend for 2026 is the decline of search clicks
as AI-generated answers replace traditional browsing behavior. To stay
visible, brands are restructuring articles with direct answers and
long question-based subheads so AI systems can extract and cite them.
Multimedia content is gaining leverage because YouTube videos and
interactive formats appear directly in AI summaries and closed
platforms. At the same time, email lists and social audiences are
becoming more valuable as owned distribution channels as search
traffic becomes more unpredictable. 

🚀 

STRATEGIES &amp; TACTICS

 FROM DEAD-END TO DISCOVERY: TURNING YOUR WORDPRESS 404 PAGE INTO A
SMART PAGE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A smarter WordPress 404 page can recover lost traffic by parsing the
failed URL and extracting meaningful keywords to automatically surface
relevant posts instead of forcing users to search again. The approach
replaces a dead-end error with contextual content discovery, using
internal search logic and sensible fallbacks to reduce bounce rates
while preserving SEO value. 

 SEO TIP: SEE HOW GOOGLE IS INDEXING YOUR SITE AT SCALE (1 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Screaming Frog&apos;s Google Search Console integration can audit
indexation at scale through the URL Inspection API. Connect the Google
account linked to GSC, select the property, enable URL Inspection, and
run a crawl in Spider mode to pull Coverage, Indexability, and last
crawl data directly into the report. It allows review of up to 2K URLs
per day and is faster than checking pages one by one in GSC. 

 POM WONDERFUL MARKETING STRATEGY AND CAMPAIGNS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 POM Wonderful turned a hard-to-use fruit into a premium functional
beverage by creating the pomegranate juice category and owning the
supply chain. Only 12% of Americans knew about pomegranates early on,
so it focused on education through its website, design, and
self-funded science while positioning the product as a luxury health
drink. It invested over $25 million in research and used provocative
campaigns like Cheat Death and fantasy-driven ads to make abstract
health claims memorable. Distinctive bottle design, vertical
integration in California farming, and broad distribution helped it
scale into a billion-dollar brand. The category is now crowded, and
its challenge is to reclaim leadership rather than blend in.

RESOURCES &amp; TOOLS

 LONGSTORIES (TOOL) [10] 

 LongStories.ai lets creators build “Universes”, reusable video
templates with set characters, voices, style, and settings. Once
built, creators can generate unlimited long-form AI videos from simple
prompts. This eliminates repeated setup and keeps videos consistent.
The platform allows creators to scale production for YouTube and other
platforms. 

 RIVERSIDE (TOOL) [11] 

 Riverside lets users record, edit, livestream, host, and publish
studio-quality audio and video. It includes multi-track 4K recording,
AI editing, and automated promotional assets. Users can create
podcasts, webinars, social clips, stream live in HD, and publish to
YouTube, Spotify, and Apple.

MISCELLANEOUS

 GOOGLE&apos;S AI OVERVIEW HAS BEEN SENDING ME THE WRONG CUSTOMERS FOR 6
MONTHS (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 For 6 months, a company received angry refund requests from people
who were not customers because Google&apos;s AI Overview repeatedly showed
the wrong support email for a similarly named business. The issue was
not a system bug but an AI hallucination that misdirected searchers,
sending hundreds of frustrated users to the wrong company. The
practical solution is to actively monitor Google AI Overviews for
brand-related searches, downvote incorrect summaries, and test results
across regions using a VPN. AI Overviews vary by country and may be
correct in some territories. 

 WHY INTERNAL COMMS SHOULD REPORT IN TO MARKETING (7 MINUTE READ) [13]


 Internal communications (IC) should report in to marketing because
employees are a core brand audience, and the internal experience must
align with the external brand. Marketing brings the skills IC needs to
succeed. Housing IC in marketing turns it from an administrative
function into a strategic one. It improves alignment with launches and
priorities, and creates more scalable employee communications while
still maintaining close ties to HR and leadership.

 THE MICROSOFT-OPENAI FILES: INTERNAL DOCUMENTS REVEAL THE REALITIES
OF AI&apos;S DEFINING ALLIANCE (27 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Elon Musk&apos;s lawsuit accusing OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman of
abandoning the nonprofit mission has unveiled over 200 documents that
offer an inside look into the relationship between OpenAI and
Microsoft. Musk, an OpenAI co-founder, is seeking up to $134 billion
in damages, with a jury trial scheduled for this Spring. The files
reveal how Microsoft pursued, rebuffed, and backed OpenAI at various
moments over the past decade. The previously undisclosed emails,
messages, slide decks, reports, and deposition transcripts show how
Microsoft ultimately shaped the course of the lab that launched the
generative AI era. 

 X OPEN SOURCES ITS ALGORITHM WHILE FACING A TRANSPARENCY FINE AND
GROK CONTROVERSIES (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 X has open sourced its algorithm, giving the world a peek behind the
company&apos;s algorithmic curtain. The site&apos;s algorithm considers
engagement history and surveys recent in-network posts when finding
content for individual users. It conducts a machine-learning-based
analysis of &apos;out of network&apos; posts that it believes the user might
also find appealing. The algorithm then filters out certain kinds of
posts, as well as content deemed too violent or spam-like, and ranks
the content based on what it thinks users will find most appealing.

 MODERNA, MERCK REPORT POSITIVE RESULTS FROM CANCER-VACCINE STUDY (1
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 In a Phase 2b trial, Moderna and Merck&apos;s cancer vaccine reduced the
risk of relapse or death in melanoma patients by 49% when used in
combination with Merck&apos;s immunotherapy Keytruda, compared to when
using Keytruda alone. The results illustrate mRNA&apos;s potential in
cancer care. The treatment continues to demonstrate sustained and
clinically meaningful improvement. The companies are currently running
eight Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials across multiple tumor types.


 THE FIRST COMMERCIAL SPACE STATION, HAVEN-1, IS NOW UNDERGOING
ASSEMBLY FOR LAUNCH (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The International Space Station is due to be decommissioned in less
than five years, but NASA has yet to formally publish rules and
requirements for a potential replacement. There are currently four
main contenders for NASA&apos;s commercial space station program: Voyager
Technologies, Axiom Space, Blue Origin, and Vast Space. NASA is
expected to select one or two of these companies for contracts later
this year. This article contains an interview with Vast&apos;s chief
executive, Max Haot. Vast is currently building a smaller interim
space station capable of short-duration stays called Haven-1.

 MCP, SKILLS, AND AGENTS (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Harnesses are constantly improving by iterating on what works well.
However, every time someone releases a new behavior, the thought
leaders of the internet determine that it has replaced all previous
functionality. Developers should try both skills and MCP to learn the
fundamentals of how the technology works and what that means for
managing the context window. How the technologies shift in the future
depends entirely on the workflows they help people solve. 

 SKILLS.SH (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Skills are reusable capabilities for AI agents. This site contains an
open agent skills ecosystem with a collection of skills anyone can
install with a single command to enhance their agents with access to
procedural knowledge. The site contains thousands of skills. The index
is searchable and shows how many times each skill has been installed.

 I&apos;M ADDICTED TO BEING USEFUL (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 People think software engineers are addicted to being useful, driven
by an addiction to solving puzzles, or drawn by power and money. What
actually motivates software engineers is often more of an internal
compulsion. It&apos;s worth figuring out what really motivates you so that
you can harness that compulsion most effectively. 

 AGENTIC AI AND THE MYTHICAL AGENT-MONTH (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The concept of &apos;Scalable Agency&apos;, where a developer could
theoretically spin up thousands of agents to complete tasks faster,
relies on a flawed assumption that software engineering is an
embarrassingly parallel task. Context loading is not the same as
common knowledge, and reading tokens is not the same as understanding
the causal chain of changes across a system. Adding manpower to a late
software project makes it later. Multi-agent systems do not escape
this law, they simply hit the wall of state-space explosion faster
than humans do.

###### AI &amp; THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM

#### 🌎 _**[AI takes center stage at WEF in Davos](https://www.weforum.org/)**_

View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/23b1cc41-5583-47cc-ad85-45cbeb7b05ff/davos2026.jpg?t=1768946977)
Caption: Image source: WEF / The Rundown 

**The Rundown: **The World Economic Forum [kicked off](https://www.weforum.org/) this week in Davos, featuring an intense focus on AI that included discussions with the industry’s top minds, including Anthropic’s Dario Amodei, Google’s Demis Hassabis, and Microsoft’s Satya Nadella.

**The details: **

* Amodei took a [shot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckt1cj0xjRM) at U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent policy allowing AI chip sales to China, likening it to “selling nuclear weapons to North Korea”. 

* Hassabis [believes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmKAnHz36v0&amp;t=3s) this year could see AI-driven slowdowns in junior hiring, but that AI tools could ultimately enable more skill creation than traditional paths. 

* Nadella [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLsoEJ7WpZY) no company can “just coast” in the AI era, stating that big companies that don’t keep up will “get schooled by someone small.”

* Amodei also said we may be just 6-12 months away from models that do “most, maybe all” of what software engineers do end-to-end.

**Why it matters: **Davos talks often stay abstract, but Amodei&apos;s timeline for full AI-powered coding puts a tight deadline on the disruption we&apos;re already seeing with tools like Claude Code. Between geopolitical warnings, labor shifts, and software upheaval, the message from AI&apos;s leaders is clear: the window to adapt is shrinking rapidly.

###### HUMANS&amp;

#### 🤝 **[_&amp;#39;Human-centric&amp;#39; AI startup raises $480M_](https://humansand.ai/)**

View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/a9fb9a46-45b1-4292-b432-f4991e324f6e/humansand.jpg?t=1768943423)
Caption: Image source: Humans&amp;

**The Rundown: **A new AI startup founded by researchers from Anthropic, xAI, and Google, just [raised](https://humansand.ai/) $480M in seed funding at a $4.48B valuation, pushing to build AI that helps people collaborate better over automation and full replacement.

**The details:**

* Humans&amp; aims to build AI that functions like an intelligent group chat, requesting context, storing memory, and coordinating teams.

* Co-founder Andi Peng left Anthropic over its autonomy focus, saying they “loved to highlight how its models churned for 8, 24, 50 hours by themselves.&quot;

* The team includes Google&apos;s seventh employee, Georges Harik, two former xAI researchers who worked on Grok, and Stanford professor Noah Goodman.

* The $480M seed round was led by SV Angel and its co-founder Harik, alongside Nvidia, Jeff Bezos, and Google Ventures. 

**Why it matters: **A $4.48B value for a 3-month old startup is wild, but shows the investor appetite for any team with a frontier lab pedigree. The &quot;human-centric&quot; angle is a shot at the autonomy-driven gains most labs are chasing, though we’ve seen similar framing from the likes of Microsoft AI (and even Anthropic in its own ads).

###### AI TRAINING

#### 📝 **_[Get better AI outputs using multiple choice](https://app.therundown.ai/guides/get-better-ai-outputs-with-this-multiple-choice-technique)_**

View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/ddee6b4a-0e11-4f12-95bf-08cf3acf916b/021_banner.jpeg?t=1768941294)
Caption: 

**The Rundown: **In this tutorial, you will learn a universal strategy to get better outputs from any AI model at a fraction of the cost by minimizing the amount of unhelpful context you add to the AI’s “brain”.

**Step-by-step:**

1. Open any chat-based AI and break your idea into Goal, Task, and Next Steps to &quot;minimize unhelpful messages&quot;. The task will be to interview to build context

2. Prompt using the Goal→Task→Next Steps pattern, e.g.: _&quot;Your job is to generate a logo... Interview me with 5-10 MCQs about my brand, vision to build context&quot;_

3. Respond to Qs with simple choices (e.g., “A, B, A, C…”). This removes miscommunication and ensures that the AI has a better understanding

4. Once it generates concepts, prompt to _&quot;Generate a 4x4 grid with each concept in a separate grid cell&quot;_ to save on tokens, then ask for standalone images

**Pro tip:** If you get great results from this method, export and re-use the context by asking the AI to &quot;extract the context as system instructions in markdown.”

###### LIGHTRICKS

#### 🎵 **[_LTX launches audio-to-video generation_](https://x.com/LTXStudio/status/2013650214171877852?s=20)**

View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/bd5f057d-f4f7-4bc2-b938-f3ca1d1257e0/ltx-audiovideo.jpg?t=1768949581)
Caption: Image source: LTX

**The Rundown: **AI creative platform Lightricks just [released](https://x.com/LTXStudio/status/2013650214171877852?s=20) a new Audio-to-Video feature, allowing users to start with voice, music, or sound effects and then generate the video output to accompany it. 

**The details: **

* The tool syncs motion, lip movements, and camera work directly to the uploaded audio, keeping consistency across generations.

* Users can upload files, record directly, or use a built-in text-to-speech tool powered by ElevenLabs’ Scribe V2 model. 

* LTX said the model can understand rhythm and beat, making it capable of music videos and timing/pacing outputs to align with audio. 

* LTX called being able to start from audio “the third paradigm in AI video generation,” allowing for more consistent and natural outputs. 

**Why it matters: **Starting with sound opens up brand new creative pathways — with the ability to build around existing audio assets rather than roughly fitting dialogue onto AI-generated clips. While AI video has already hit such a high bar, tools enabling consistency and customization are the next lever to take models to new heights.

Every newsletter, we showcase how a reader is using AI to work smarter, save time, or make life easier.

Today’s workflow comes from reader **Matt R.** in London, UK:

&quot;I was making my annual family calendar and found that a number of my wife&apos;s Apple photos were in HEIC format, which weren&apos;t accepted by Snapfish. I looked for a file converter to get them into JPGs, and was quickly browsing the spate of &apos;free&apos; options that don&apos;t tell you that to convert more than one file, you have to hand over your credit card.

I asked Mocha to build me a HEIC to JPG converter, and 5 minutes later, it was ready and operational!&quot;
